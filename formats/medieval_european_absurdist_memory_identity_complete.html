<h1 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-1-1"><strong>CHAPTER 1</strong></h2>
<p>Godefroy remembered the pig. This was inconvenient, as he was
currently being knighted. The bishop’s miter swam before him, a gilded
fish, while the porcine squeal from twenty years past lodged in his ear
like a burr. He could not recall his new motto, but he could taste the
mud of that sty with perfect, humiliating clarity.</p>
<p>I turned. A man with a face like a disappointed potato was glaring at
me, hands on his hips. He was missing several key teeth. “Well?” he
said. “Are you harvesting or are you conducting a philosophical
symposium with the root vegetables?”</p>
<p><em>Emeric.</em> Right. That had a familiar weight to it, like a worn
shoe. I looked down at my hands. They were holding a wooden spade. They
were my hands, presumably. They were dirty. “Sorry,” I said. The word
felt strange in my mouth, a foreign coin.</p>
<p>“Sorry buys no turnips,” Potato-Face said. He was named Baldric, I
suddenly remembered. Or maybe I invented it. He was my brother-in-law, a
fact that seemed both plausible and utterly absurd. “The rent is due to
Sir Guy on Thursday. He wants his silver, not your contemplative
silences.”</p>
<p>I drove the spade into the cold earth. The action was mechanical.
<em>I am Emeric. I am in a field. It is autumn. The rent is due.</em> I
assembled the facts like stacking loose bricks. A memory, or the ghost
of one, flitted past: a woman’s laugh, the smell of baking barley bread.
My wife? Agnes. Agnes was dead. The plague, two years past. The memory
was flat, a painted backdrop. I felt nothing about it, which in turn
made me feel a profound, hollow guilt. Shouldn’t I feel something?
Baldric had loved her too, his sister. He mostly felt the loss of her
help around his hovel.</p>
<p>We worked in silence broken by the thunk of spades and Baldric’s
occasional grunts of dissatisfaction, directed at the yield, the
weather, me. The village of Wormsley-on-the-Mire was waking up. Smoke
began to thread from the wattle-and-daub huts. A pig screamed somewhere
with existential fury. The world had a sharp, damp smell of woodsmoke,
rotting leaves, and distant manure. It was real, painfully so. And yet I
felt encased in a thin layer of glass, observing it all from a slight,
unbridgeable distance.</p>
<p>The problem, you see, wasn’t just forgetting. It was the constant,
quiet <em>replacement</em>. Gaps don’t stay empty. They fill with
something else.</p>
<p>As I heaved a clump of turnips into the sack, a different memory
inserted itself, vivid and bright as a stained-glass window. Not of
Agnes, but of a vast, echoing hall. Stone flags underfoot. The smell of
incense and wet dog. A man on a throne, his crown slightly too large,
nodding off as a jester sang a rude song about a bishop and a goose. I
felt the memory’s texture—the chill of the stone, the ache in my feet
from standing. I had never been to a royal court. I was Emeric of
Wormsley, a turnip-farmer with a dead wife and a debt to Sir Guy. And
yet, the memory sat there, solid and undeniable. I could taste the stale
court wine.</p>
<p>“You’ve got that look again,” Baldric said, wiping his nose on his
sleeve. “Like a sheep trying to recall trigonometry.”</p>
<p>“I was thinking of taxes,” I lied.</p>
<p>“Thinking is what got you into this muddle. Do less of it.”</p>
<p>A horn sounded from the direction of the manor house, a low, mournful
blare that cut through the morning mist. Baldric froze, his face
shifting from potato-ish disappointment to potato-ish terror. “The
levy,” he whispered, as if the horn itself could hear him. “Sir Guy’s
men. They’re early.”</p>
<p>Chaos, of a soggy, English variety, ensued. Across the field, other
peasants began to scramble, dragging sacks into huts, shooing children
inside. Baldric was frantically digging a small, pointless hole. “Help
me bury the best of the turnips! The crooked ones we’ll give them.”</p>
<p>“Why are we burying vegetables?” I asked, genuinely curious. The
memory of the court had left me disoriented.</p>
<p>“Because Sir Guy’s steward, Fulke, counts every pea! He’ll take a
third of what he sees. If he sees less, he takes less. It’s basic
arithmetic of misery.”</p>
<p>It seemed a flawed system, reliant on the poor hiding skills of
terrified peasants, but I took up my spade and helped. We were patting
down the earth over our cache of premium turnips when the horses
arrived.</p>
<p>There were three of them. Two men-at-arms in rust-spotted mail,
looking bored and cold. And between them, on a pony that seemed to share
his general philosophy of life, was Fulke the Steward. He was a thin
man, all angles and parchment, with eyes that did not twinkle. He
carried a wax tablet and a stylus.</p>
<p>“Baldric,” Fulke intoned, his voice like a dry hinge. “And Emeric.
The bereaved.” He made a note on his tablet. The scratch of the stylus
was unnaturally loud. “The quarterly levy for your plot. In produce or
equivalent silver penny. Sir Guy is financing a new tapestry. It depicts
his victory over the Welsh wind that once blew his hat off. It is a
costly masterpiece.”</p>
<p>Baldric grovelled, which involved a sort of full-body cringe. “Good
steward, the season has been wet, the turnips are melancholic, we have
barely enough to—”</p>
<p>Fulke held up a skeletal hand. He dismounted with a series of clicks
and creaks and walked to our sack. He peered in. He prodded a turnip
with the tip of his stylus. “These are of poor quality. Small.
Misshapen. They look… philosophically conflicted.”</p>
<p>“The soil is uncertain,” I said.</p>
<p>Fulke’s gaze slid to me. It was like being looked at by a bookkeeper
from the underworld. “The soil is always uncertain. It is its nature.
Your rent, however, is very certain.” He made another note. “Given the
inferior stock, I assess your levy at one-half of visible produce.”</p>
<p>Baldric whimpered. This was worse than a third.</p>
<p>Then Fulke’s foot, clad in a surprisingly elegant pointed shoe,
tapped the ground where we’d buried the good turnips. The earth was
slightly fresher. “What is here?”</p>
<p>“A grave,” I said quickly. “For a favourite hen. ‘Clucky.’ A tragic
loss.”</p>
<p>Fulke stared at me. The men-at-arms shifted. Baldric looked like he
was about to faint into the mud.</p>
<p>“A hen,” Fulke repeated.</p>
<p>“She had personality,” I said. “A sense of humour about the
rain.”</p>
<p>For a long moment, the only sound was the distant, existential pig.
Then Fulke’s lips stretched into something that used the same muscles as
a smile but conveyed only a deeper, more calculating coldness. “Dig it
up.”</p>
<p>“Steward, to disturb the dead—”</p>
<p>“Dig. It. Up. Or I shall assume you are concealing taxable assets and
levy your entire plot, your hut, and the shirt off your back, which,
frankly, would be a service to public decency.”</p>
<p>Defeated, Baldric began to dig with his hands. I joined him. We
unearthed our plump, virtuous turnips. They looked obscenely healthy
lying in the dirt next to the pathetic ones from the sack.</p>
<p>Fulke made a long, slow note on his tablet. “Concealment of quality
produce. Attempted deception of manorial authority. The levy is now
three-quarters of total yield, including the subterranean cache.” He
glanced at our hut. “And that bronze pot by your hearth. Sir Guy’s new
tapestry requires a border of seraphic fire. The pot will provide the
material.”</p>
<p>Baldric let out a low moan. That pot was his last thing of value, the
only thing that hadn’t been sold or taken after Agnes died.</p>
<p>A hot, unfamiliar anger rose in my throat. It was clean and sharp,
unlike the fuzzy confusion of my memories. This was wrong. It was a
small, stupid, petty wrong, but it was absolute. Before I knew what I
was doing, I spoke.</p>
<p>“Article 12 of the Manorial Customary of 1215,” I heard myself say.
My voice was different. Clearer. It rang in the damp air. “As recorded
by the Clerk of Wormsley, one Bartholomew the Scribe, of blessed memory.
‘No levy may exceed one-half of a tenant’s visible yield in a poor
season, as judged by the steward’s discretion, save in case of war or
papal interdict.’ Is there a war, Steward Fulke? Has the Pope placed
Wormsley-under-the-Mire under interdict?”</p>
<p>The silence that followed was profound. The bored men-at-arms were
now alert, looking from me to Fulke. Baldric had stopped breathing.
Fulke’s stylus hovered over his tablet. He looked at me as if I had just
grown a second, equally stupid head.</p>
<p>“What did you say?” he whispered.</p>
<p>“The Customary,” I repeated. “The one Sir Guy’s grandfather signed.
It’s nailed to the door of the manor chapel. Under the bird
droppings.”</p>
<p>I had no memory of ever seeing it. But I knew it. I knew the feel of
the vellum, the faded brown ink, the clumsy signature of “Guy de
Wormsley” at the bottom. I knew Bartholomew the Scribe had a wart on his
left thumb that left a smudge on the lower margin.</p>
<p>Fulke’s face had gone the colour of old cheese. His authority was a
brittle thing, built on the collective forgetting of peasants. He relied
on no one remembering yesterday, let alone a document from seventy years
ago. My remembering was an act of profound, inexplicable violence.</p>
<p>“You are mistaken,” he hissed.</p>
<p>“I am not,” I said, the certainty solid as stone within me. “And
Article 14 stipulates that a tenant’s cooking pot is inviolate, being
essential to the sustenance of life and the boiling of suspicious water.
Unless you are declaring a state of famine?”</p>
<p>Fulke took a step back. He closed his wax tablet with a snap. He
looked at me not with anger, but with a kind of superstitious dread. I
had broken the rules of the world. Peasants did not quote manorial
customaries. They grumbled, they buried turnips, they paid.</p>
<p>“Take the half-sack,” he said to the men-at-arms, his voice
strangled. “Leave the pot. And the… the grave goods.” He mounted his
pony with stiff, jerky movements. He couldn’t meet my eye. As he turned
his beast, he finally looked at me, and it was a look of pure,
unadulterated hatred, not for my defiance, but for my impossible
knowledge. “This isn’t over, Emeric. Men who remember things they
shouldn’t… they have accidents. They fall into rivers. They forget how
to breathe.”</p>
<p>He kicked his pony and trotted away, his men following, leaving
Baldric and me standing in the ravaged turnip field with a pile of good
vegetables and a terrifying victory.</p>
<p>Baldric was the first to move. He slowly, carefully, picked up a
perfect turnip. He stared at it. Then he stared at me, his eyes wide
with fear.</p>
<p>“Who in the name of all that is mouldy are you?” he breathed.</p>
<p>I looked at my dirty hands. I felt the ghost of a stone floor under
my feet, heard the echo of a jester’s song. I remembered the Manorial
Customary word for word.</p>
<p>“I’m Emeric,” I said, but it sounded like a question. “Your
brother-in-law.”</p>
<p>Baldric took a step back, clutching the turnip to his chest like a
holy relic. “No,” he said. “Agnes’s Emeric couldn’t read his own name.
Agnes’s Emeric was a good, forgettable man. You… you remembered
something. And now we’re all dead.”</p>
<p>He turned and fled towards the hut, leaving me alone in the field
with two sacks of turnips, a buried hen that never existed, and a head
full of other people’s memories.</p>
<p>The second thing I was beginning to forget was how to be afraid. It
was being crowded out by a much stranger, more vertiginous feeling: the
terrifying freedom of knowing things you have no right to know.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-2-1"><strong>CHAPTER 2</strong></h2>
<p>Baldric did not speak to me for the rest of the day. He communicated
via a series of pointed silences, aggressive pot-clanging, and the
strategic placement of his body between me and the hearth, as if I were
a source of dangerous draughts. The bronze pot, saved from the
tapestry’s seraphic fire, hung from its hook, a monument to my
transgression.</p>
<p>I sat on a wobbly stool, mending a fishing net with fingers that
seemed to know the knots better than I did. The memory—no, the
<em>knowledge</em>—of the Manorial Customary sat in my mind like a
foreign object. I probed it. I could recall the exact phrasing of
Article 7 regarding the milling rights, the penalty for stealing acorns
(three pence or a day in the stocks, weather permitting), the obscure
clause about the manor’s responsibility for goose-related injuries
during Michaelmas. It was all there, crisp and complete. But I could not
remember learning it. I could not remember Bartholomew the Scribe. I
could not, for that matter, remember learning to read.</p>
<p>Agnes’s Emeric, Baldric insisted, was illiterate. A simple man. A
good man, but one whose world was bounded by the field, the river, the
hut, and the church. He liked ale, disliked rain, and had a laugh that
sounded, according to Baldric, “like a donkey choking on a joy.” This
portrait felt both familiar and alien. It was like being shown a sketch
of a stranger and told it was your reflection.</p>
<p>As dusk seeped into the hut, thick as stew, Baldric finally broke his
silence. He was stirring a thin pottage of turnips, water, and a single,
mournful-looking leek. “Fulke will be back,” he said, not looking at me.
“Not with a levy. With a rope. Or a knife in the dark.”</p>
<p>“He has no legal grounds,” I said, the words coming out with an
infuriating, clerkly confidence.</p>
<p>Baldric’s wooden spoon halted. “Legal? <em>Legal?</em>” He gave a
short, barking laugh that held no humour. “The law is what Sir Guy and
his pointed shoes say it is after supper. You shamed Fulke. In front of
his men. You made him look like a fool who doesn’t know his own lord’s
rules. He can’t have that. A steward’s power is ninety parts ‘everyone
believes he knows what he’s doing.’ You cracked that belief. Now he has
to crack you.”</p>
<p>He was right, of course. My borrowed knowledge had shown me the rule,
but Baldric’s native, fearful wisdom understood the reality. The memory
of Fulke’s face, that look of superstitious hatred, returned to me. It
was more chilling than any threat.</p>
<p>“What do you suggest?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Leave,” Baldric said simply. “Tonight. Go to the next village. The
next shire. Change your name. Forget you were ever here.”</p>
<p>“I seem to have a problem with the forgetting part.”</p>
<p>“Then <em>try harder</em>!” he snapped, slamming the spoon down. “You
think I want you here? A man who quotes charters at stewards? You’re a
lightning rod for trouble. Agnes would…” He trailed off, his anger
deflating into a soggy misery. “Agnes would want you safe. Even if you
are… different now.”</p>
<p><em>Different.</em> The word hung in the smoky air. Was I? Or was I
just remembering more? Or was I remembering <em>wrong</em>?</p>
<p>A new memory surfaced, unbidden. Not a document, but a sensation. The
feel of fine wool, dyed a deep blue, against my fingertips. The smell of
lavender and mint. A woman’s voice, soft and cultured, speaking in
French: <em>“One must always check the tension on the warp, or the whole
tapestry will list.”</em> I saw hands, not my own—pale, slender hands,
guiding a thread of gold through a complex loom. The memory was warm,
peaceful, and utterly, devastatingly not mine.</p>
<p>I gasped, a small, sharp intake of breath.</p>
<p>Baldric looked at me, alarmed. “What now? Remembered the tax on
gooseberries?”</p>
<p>“A tapestry,” I whispered. “I was thinking of a tapestry.”</p>
<p>He stared at me as if I’d said I was thinking of riding a griffon to
Constantinople. “We have no tapestries. We have walls. And mud.”</p>
<p>The disconnect was terrifying. These memories weren’t just facts;
they were sensory experiences, emotions, lives. They were vivid and real
and they belonged to someone else. I was a leaky vessel, and other
people’s pasts were pouring in.</p>
<p>“I need air,” I said, standing up so fast the stool fell over.</p>
<p>I stumbled out of the hut into the deepening twilight.
Wormsley-on-the-Mire was settling into night. Fires glowed behind
shutters. The air was cold and clean, smelling of damp earth and night.
I walked past the sleeping pig, past the well with its foul-tasting
water, towards the edge of the village where the land sloped down to the
Mire—a broad, peat-black expanse of bog and reed that gave the place its
name and its pervasive smell of decay.</p>
<p>I needed to think. To anchor myself. I was Emeric. I had a dead wife
named Agnes. I lived with my brother-in-law Baldric. I farmed turnips.
These were my facts. My bricks. I would build a wall with them to keep
the sea of other memories out.</p>
<p>I reached the old willow that marked the safe path into the Mire. Its
branches wept into the dark water. And there, sitting on a root with his
back to me, was a figure.</p>
<p>He was singing. Or chanting. A low, repetitive drone that blended
with the buzzing of the evening insects.</p>
<p><em>“The king who forgot his crown,</em> <em>The saint who forgot his
prayer,</em> <em>The lover who forgot his vow,</em> <em>All find their
answer there.</em> <em>In the Mire, in the Mire,</em> <em>Where the
memories retire…”</em></p>
<p>I cleared my throat.</p>
<p>The figure stopped singing but did not turn. “You’re standing in
Ethelred the Unready,” he said. His voice was reedy, like the wind
through the rushes.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry?”</p>
<p>“Your left foot. You’re standing where Ethelred the Unready camped in
1016. He forgot to post sentries. The Danes surprised him. It was a
whole thing.” The figure finally turned. He was an old man, so wrinkled
he seemed to be made of cured leather. He had bright, milky-blue eyes
that saw too much. He was known as Old Tom, the village madman. He lived
in a hovel even worse than ours and was said to eat frogs.</p>
<p>“Old Tom,” I said.</p>
<p>“Emeric,” he replied, nodding. “Or are you today? Sometimes you’re
someone else. I can see it around the edges. Like a poorly-fitting
hat.”</p>
<p>A chill that had nothing to do with the evening crept down my spine.
“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>He patted the root beside him. I sat, cautiously. The peat smell was
strong here, earthy and ancient.</p>
<p>“The Mire remembers,” Old Tom said, gesturing out at the black
expanse. “It swallows things. Swords, carts, armies, kings. And their
memories. They sink down into the peat and the quiet. But memories are
bubbles. They rise. Sometimes they pop in the wrong head.” He tapped his
own temple. “I get the kings. Mostly the bad, forgetful ones. You… you
seem to be getting the clerks. And the weavers.”</p>
<p>I stared at him, my heart pounding. “How could you know that?”</p>
<p>He chuckled, a sound like dry leaves. “I told you. I see the hat.
You’re wearing a clerk’s coif right now. It’s a bit tight. Earlier, you
had a weaver’s kerchief. Very becoming.” He leaned closer, his breath
smelling of mushrooms and secrets. “The Mire is getting restless. It’s
giving back what it took. It’s tired of remembering for everyone. It
wants to share the burden.”</p>
<p>“That’s madness,” I whispered.</p>
<p>“Is it?” Old Tom asked, his milky eyes wide. “You remembered the
Customary, didn’t you? You knew about Bartholomew’s wart. You can feel
the wool of a tapestry you never saw. Is that <em>sanity</em>?”</p>
<p>I had no answer. The solid ground of my identity was not just
cracking; it was turning into bog under my feet.</p>
<p>“What do I do?” The question escaped me, desperate and small.</p>
<p>Old Tom considered, sucking on his few teeth. “Most people, when a
strange memory comes, they drown it in ale or frighten it away with
prayer. They pretend it’s indigestion. You… you listened to yours. You
used it. That’s dangerous. The memories will like that. They’ll come
more often. Louder.” He looked at me with something like pity. “You have
two choices, Emeric-Who-Is-Not-Always-Emeric. You can run. Go far away
where the Mire’s breath can’t reach you. Maybe the memories will
fade.”</p>
<p>“And the second choice?”</p>
<p>“You can learn to sort the mail,” he said, grinning.</p>
<p>“Sort the… what?”</p>
<p>“The memories. They’re letters addressed to other people. Delivered
to you by a drunken postman. You have to read the name on the front. Is
this for Emeric the Turnip-Farmer? Or for Brother Anselm the Clerk? Or
for Lady Eleanor the Weaver? If it’s not for you, don’t open it. Put it
in a drawer. A quiet drawer in the back of your mind. Otherwise…” he
shrugged, “…you’ll open a letter about how to govern a kingdom when
you’re just trying to plant turnips. And then you’ll really be in
trouble.”</p>
<p>It was the most absurd and the most sensible advice I had ever
received.</p>
<p>Before I could respond, a new sound cut through the twilight. Not the
existential pig, but the jingle of harness and the soft thud of hooves
on the damp path. Coming from the direction of the manor.</p>
<p>Old Tom’s playful demeanour vanished. He melted back into the shadows
of the willow, his bright eyes the last thing to disappear. “Too late
for choices,” his voice whispered from the darkness. “The postman is
here. And he looks angry.”</p>
<p>I stood up. Two riders emerged from the gloom. Not Fulke this time.
The men-at-arms from the levy. They rode up to me, their faces hard in
the fading light.</p>
<p>“Emeric,” the larger one said. It wasn’t a question.</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Sir Guy wants a word.”</p>
<p>“About the levy? It was settled.”</p>
<p>The man-at-arms smiled, a thin, unpleasant slice in his beard. “Not
about the levy. About your… remarkable memory. Sir Guy is a connoisseur
of rare things. And he finds a peasant who knows manorial law to be a
very rare thing indeed. He wants to see this wonder for himself.”</p>
<p>Baldric’s prediction echoed in my head. <em>A rope or a knife in the
dark.</em> This was worse. This was official interest.</p>
<p>“Now?” I asked, stalling.</p>
<p>“Now,” the man said. He gestured with his head towards the manor.
“Walk. We’ll follow.”</p>
<p>There was nothing to do but obey. As I walked back through the
village, the riders a few paces behind, I felt the eyes of Wormsley upon
me from behind shuttered windows. The man who remembered. The lightning
rod.</p>
<p>I tried to follow Old Tom’s advice. I tried to sort the mail. The
fear pounding in my chest was Emeric’s. The cold dread was Emeric’s. But
as we approached the manor house—a modest stone building that aspired to
grandeur and achieved only damp—another memory-letter slammed into my
mind, uninvited.</p>
<p><em>The smell of wet stone and torch-smoke. The creak of a heavy
door. The feeling of walking towards a judgement you cannot
avoid.</em></p>
<p>This memory was not warm. It was cold and sharp. It was mine, I
realized with a jolt. Not a clerk’s, not a weaver’s. It was Emeric’s.
The last time I was summoned to the manor. Two years ago. To be told
Agnes was dead in the pestilence that had swept through the lower huts.
Sir Guy had told me, not out of kindness, but because her death meant my
rent would be harder to pay. He’d offered to cancel my lease, to take
the land back. I’d begged for more time. He’d granted it, with a sneer,
and doubled the interest.</p>
<p>This memory was real. It was painful and sharp and <em>mine</em>. It
anchored me even as it terrified me. I held onto it like a knife.</p>
<p>The manor door loomed ahead, oak and iron. One of the men-at-arms
dismounted and pushed it open.</p>
<p>“In,” he said.</p>
<p>I took a deep breath of the cold, bog-scented air, clutched my own,
terrible memory, and stepped into the mouth of the stone beast.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-3">Chapter 3</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-3-1"><strong>CHAPTER 3</strong></h2>
<p>The hall was exactly as I remembered it from my own memory, not the
borrowed one of a royal court. It was long, low, and perpetually damp.
Rushes, old enough to have their own ecosystems, covered the floor. The
air was thick with the smell of woodsmoke, wet dog, and a faint,
underlying note of mildew. At the far end, on a dais, sat Sir Guy de
Wormsley.</p>
<p>He was a man built for disappointment. His body seemed to sag under
the weight of its own ambitions, which forever outstripped his
resources. He had the pointed shoes, yes, but the leather was cracked.
He had a fur-trimmed robe, but the fur was patchy and molting. His face
was long and pale, with the perpetual expression of a man who has just
smelled something faintly off. A scribe sat at a small table to his
right, quill poised. And to his left, standing like a gaunt shadow, was
Fulke, whose eyes fixed on me with the intensity of a stoat watching a
rabbit.</p>
<p>“The peasant, my lord,” the man-at-arms announced, giving me a shove
forward.</p>
<p>I stumbled on the uneven rushes. My own memory of this place—the
crushing grief, the humiliation—was a live coal in my chest. It fought
with the absurd, clerkly knowledge in my head. I was Emeric, the
bereaved tenant. I was also, apparently, a walking archive.</p>
<p>Sir Guy took a slow sip from a pewter goblet. “Emeric,” he said. His
voice was flat, nasal. “Fulke tells me a remarkable tale. He says you
quoted the Manorial Customary of 1215. Article 12. And 14.”</p>
<p>I said nothing. Baldric’s warning screamed in my mind.</p>
<p>“How is it,” Sir Guy continued, placing his goblet down with precise
care, “that a man who, by all accounts, could not tell a ‘P’ from a
ploughshare, suddenly has the laws of this manor at his fingertips?”</p>
<p>The scribe’s quill hovered, ready to record my confession to
witchcraft or sedition.</p>
<p>I chose my words as if walking on bog-ice. “My lord, my wife, Agnes…
she was a devout woman. She believed in knowing one’s place. And the
rules of that place. She had the priest, Father Cuthbert, read the
Customary to her once. She remembered it. She told me.” The lie came
easily, woven from threads of truth. Agnes <em>had</em> been devout.
Father Cuthbert <em>could</em> read, after a fashion. It was plausible.
It was safe.</p>
<p>Fulke leaned forward. “A woman’s gossip? Retold by a simpleton? And
he recalls it <em>verbatim</em>, years later? Forgive my skepticism, my
lord.”</p>
<p>Sir Guy held up a hand, silencing him. His watery eyes studied me.
“Father Cuthbert has a head like a sieve and a tongue loosened by
communion wine. He can barely remember the Lord’s Prayer. Yet you,
Emeric, remember every clause.” He leaned forward. “Recite Article 7 for
me. The milling rights.”</p>
<p>The request was a trap. Agree, and I proved my impossible knowledge.
Refuse, and I proved my guilt. The memory was right there, the text
clear as day in my mind. I could see the brown ink, the smudge. I opened
my mouth.</p>
<p>And then I thought of Old Tom. <em>Sort the mail.</em></p>
<p>This memory was not addressed to Emeric the Grieving Widower. It was
addressed to Brother Anselm the Clerk. It was not my letter to open.</p>
<p>I let my face go slack, the picture of peasant confusion. I scratched
my head. “Article 7, my lord? That’s… that’s the one about the… the
geese, isn’t it? At Michaelmas?”</p>
<p>A flicker of doubt passed over Sir Guy’s face. Fulke’s scowl
deepened.</p>
<p>“No,” Sir Guy said slowly. “That is not Article 7.”</p>
<p>I shrugged, a masterpiece of bewildered helplessness. “Then I’m
mistaken, my lord. My Agnes, she tried to tell me, God rest her soul,
but it was all a muddle. Taxes and geese and milling… it’s too much for
a head that’s meant for turnips. I only remembered the bit about the pot
because… well, it’s my pot. I didn’t want to lose it.” I infused my
voice with a pathetic whine. It wasn’t hard.</p>
<p>Sir Guy sat back, disappointed. He had hoped for a wonder, a
curiosity to break the monotony of his damp lordship. He had found,
instead, a confused peasant who’d gotten lucky. He glanced at Fulke, a
look that said, <em>You disturbed me for this?</em></p>
<p>But Fulke was not convinced. His was a mind that trusted nothing,
especially not convenient stupidity. “My lord,” he pressed, “his
precision this morning was uncanny. He spoke of Bartholomew the Scribe’s
<em>wart</em>.”</p>
<p>Sir Guy waved a dismissive hand. “Everyone knows about Bartholomew’s
wart. It was legendary. The man could barely hold a pen. The point,
Fulke, is that he does <em>not</em> know Article 7. He is an idiot, not
a scholar. You were bested by an idiot and a dead woman’s prattle. That
reflects poorly on you, not him.”</p>
<p>Fulke’s jaw tightened. The rebuke was public and stinging. He had
lost face, and he would not forget who he blamed.</p>
<p>“However,” Sir Guy said, turning his flat gaze back to me, “while you
may be a forgetful fool, you are <em>my</em> forgetful fool. Your
public… correction… of my steward has caused talk. It has introduced an
element of… uncertainty. I cannot have uncertainty among the tenantry.
It leads to ideas.”</p>
<p>He steepled his fingers. “Therefore, you will perform a service. A
demonstration of loyalty and contrition. In three days’ time, I am
hosting a boar hunt. The Lord of Blackmere and his retinue will be
guests. We require a fool.”</p>
<p>My blood ran cold. “A fool, my lord?”</p>
<p>“A jester. A merry-andrew. Someone to provide amusement during the
feast. We had engaged a fellow from Oxford, but he appears to have
forgotten the engagement and gone to Lincoln instead. An epidemic of
forgetfulness, it seems.” He didn’t smile. “You will take his
place.”</p>
<p>“But my lord, I am not funny. I am a farmer.”</p>
<p>“Precisely,” Sir Guy said, a thin smile finally touching his lips. “A
farming fool. You will perform a rustic routine. You will sing a
humorous song about turnips. You will fall over in the rushes. You will
be the butt of the joke. You will remind everyone, including yourself,
of your station. It will repair the disruption you have caused. It will
be a lesson in humility, performed for the entertainment of my
peers.”</p>
<p>It was a punishment far more exquisite than a beating. It was a
ritual humiliation, designed to strip me of any accidental dignity I had
gained. It would cement me, forever, as “Emeric the Fool” in the eyes of
the village and the manor.</p>
<p>Fulke’s expression shifted from anger to a slow, cruel satisfaction.
This was better than a knife in the dark.</p>
<p>I opened my mouth to protest, to beg, but Sir Guy’s gaze silenced me.
“Refuse,” he said softly, “and your lease is forfeit. You and your
brother-in-law will be out, on the road, with winter coming. The Mire is
cold this time of year. It forgets to be merciful.”</p>
<p>There was no choice. I bowed my head. “Yes, my lord.”</p>
<p>“Good. Fulke will provide you with a costume. Bells. Perhaps a turnip
on a stick. Dismissed.”</p>
<p>The men-at-arms grabbed my arms and marched me out. As the heavy door
shut behind me, leaving me in the cold night, the full weight of the
sentence crashed down. I was to be a fool. A performing animal.</p>
<p>I walked back through the sleeping village in a daze. The absurdity
of it was perfect. I, a man haunted by other people’s memories, was to
play the forgetful, simple peasant for sport. The universe, or the Mire,
or God, had a vicious sense of humour.</p>
<p>When I pushed open the door to our hut, Baldric was waiting, his face
pale in the firelight. “Well? Are we to be hanged?”</p>
<p>“Worse,” I said, my voice hollow. “We’re to be entertained.”</p>
<p>I told him. As I spoke, his face cycled through fear, anger, and
finally, a kind of resigned despair. When I finished, he sat heavily on
his stool and put his head in his hands.</p>
<p>“A fool,” he muttered. “We’ll be the laughing stock. They’ll never
let us forget it. ‘There goes Baldric, brother-in-law to the
turnip-jester.’” He looked up, his eyes bleak. “Why couldn’t you just
have let him take the pot?”</p>
<p>I had no answer. Because a memory that wasn’t mine told me not to?
Because I was losing my mind?</p>
<p>That night, as Baldric snored in fitful bursts, I lay awake on my
pallet of straw. The thatch above me was black. I closed my eyes, and
immediately, the memories came, not as letters now, but as a flood.</p>
<p><em>The feel of a lute in my hands, calluses on my fingertips from
the strings. A crowd laughing, not at me, but with me. A quick, sharp
joke about a bishop’s horse that brings a roar from a sun-drenched
courtyard. The warmth of approval. The skill of it. The
control.</em></p>
<p>This was not the dread of the manor hall. This was different. This
was a memory of performance, of artistry, of wielding laughter like a
weapon. It was confident. It was joyful.</p>
<p>It was the memory of a professional fool.</p>
<p>And as it washed over me, a plan began to form in the darkness. A
terrible, absurd, possibly suicidal plan.</p>
<p>Sir Guy wanted a fool. The Mire was sending me the memories of one.
Perhaps, just for one night, I wouldn’t sort the mail. Perhaps I would
open it, read it, and perform it.</p>
<p>If I was to be a fool, I would not be Sir Guy’s bumbling, rustic
clown. I would be the fool from the memory. The one who knew how to make
kings laugh, and how to make stings feel like kisses.</p>
<p>It was either brilliance or the final unraveling of my mind. In the
absolute darkness, feeling the weight of the peat-black Mire all around
us, holding the memories of forgotten kings and clumsy scribes, I could
no longer tell the difference.</p>
<p>The third thing I forgot was the line between memory and identity.
And in that forgetting, I found, for the first time, a sliver of
something that felt like power.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-4">Chapter 4</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-4-1"><strong>CHAPTER 4</strong></h2>
<p>The first thing I remembered was a song about a one-legged gull. It
came to me not as a memory, but as a fact, like the taste of salt or the
feel of splintered wood underfoot. I was walking the mud-track away from
Baldric’s, a sack of turnips (a parting gift, or perhaps a final insult)
slung over my shoulder, and the tune was just <em>there</em>, humming in
the back of my teeth. It was a stupid, cheerful tune. The memory-fool
had loved it.</p>
<p>The plan, that terrible, absurd plan, was a cold stone in my gut. It
had seemed like a sliver of power in the dark. In the greasy light of a
Mire-morning, it felt like agreeing to perform surgery with a rusted
spoon. I was to present myself at Redgrave Manor as a professional
jester. I, who forgot my own name if no one said it for an hour. I,
whose entire comic repertoire consisted of Baldric’s face when a turnip
was misshapen.</p>
<p>But the other memories—the lute calluses, the sun-drenched
laughter—they were solid. They were a set of instructions written on my
bones. I just had to hope my body would remember how to read them.</p>
<p>The safehouse wasn’t a house. It was the corpse of a boat, a
fat-bellied river barge that had sunk into the peat on the edge of the
Mire a hundred years ago. Its ribs curved up out of the black water like
the skeleton of a great, sad beast. Moss and sickly yellow fungus
bearded its planks. It was the kind of place you told children about to
make them behave.</p>
<p>A voice, low and rough as peat-gravel, came from the shadow of its
hull. “If you’re lost, you’re already dead. If you’re not, you’re
early.”</p>
<p>I stopped. “I was told to come. By the stars.”</p>
<p>A snort. “Romantic. And inaccurate. It was by the smell of
desperation, more like. Get in. You’re letting the damp in.”</p>
<p>I ducked under the curve of the hull. Inside, it was less a cabin and
more a cave someone had decided to tolerate. A single tallow candle
guttered on an upturned barrel. By its light, I saw a woman. She was
maybe fifty, maybe seventy; the Mire etched ages that didn’t match the
calendar. Her hair was a grey twist of rope, her face a topography of
scars and hard lines. She wore a patched tunic and trousers, and she was
sharpening a long, thin blade on a stone with a rhythmic
<em>shush-shush</em> that was the only clean sound in the place.</p>
<p>“Emeric?” she said, not looking up.</p>
<p>“For now.”</p>
<p>At that, she glanced at me. Her eyes were the colour of flint. “Good
answer. Sit. You can call me Kaela. And you can put the turnips outside.
This isn’t a soup kitchen.”</p>
<p>I dropped the sack by the entrance and sat on a mildewed crate. The
air smelled of wet rot, old smoke, and a sharp, herbal tang I didn’t
know.</p>
<p>“Baldric said you could explain,” I said. “About the… memories. The
things that aren’t mine.”</p>
<p>She tested the edge of her blade with her thumb. “Baldric is a
frightened man who thinks the world is a ledger. He sees a column of
numbers that doesn’t add up and calls it witchcraft. It’s not.” She
sheathed the blade at her hip. “Your grandfather was a Wayfinder.”</p>
<p>The word meant nothing. It sat between us like a strange rock.</p>
<p>“A what?”</p>
<p>“A navigator. But not of rivers or roads.” She leaned forward, the
candlelight carving deep hollows under her cheekbones. “You know how in
the Mire, you’ll sometimes find a coin from a kingdom that never was? Or
a tool made for a hand with six fingers?”</p>
<p>I nodded. Everyone knew those stories. The Mire coughed up oddities
the way a sick man coughs phlegm.</p>
<p>“They’re not from <em>here</em>,” she said. “They’re from Elsewhere.
Other realms. Other layers of the world, stacked like pages in a book.
Most people are born, live, and die on their own page. They can’t even
conceive of the next. But some… some have a knack for feeling the gaps.
For finding the seams between the pages. Wayfinders. They could walk
from one reality to another. Traders, messengers, thieves, refugees.
Your grandfather was one of the best.”</p>
<p>I felt the world tilt, not dramatically, but with a slow, nauseating
precision, like a boat taking on water. “And the memories?”</p>
<p>“Collateral,” she said, as if it were obvious. “You don’t walk
between worlds without brushing against them. You pick up dust. Echoes.
Stray thoughts. For most Wayfinders, it’s a whisper, a headache. But
you… you’re a sieve. You don’t just brush against the other pages, you
soak them up. The memories aren’t invading you. You’re remembering
places you’ve technically never been. People you’ve never met. Their
lives are bleeding into yours because your boundaries are… faulty.”</p>
<p>A clerical error in the soul. I had called it that myself, in the
turnip field. I just hadn’t known the scale of the ledger.</p>
<p>“So I’m not going mad.”</p>
<p>“Oh, you might be,” Kaela said with a grim smile. “That’s a separate
issue. But the memories are real. They’re just not yours.” She reached
behind the barrel and tossed a small, cloth-wrapped bundle onto my lap.
“He left you this. For when you were ready. I suppose the Mire decided
you were ready.”</p>
<p>I unwrapped it. Inside was a compass. But it was all wrong. The
casing was a dull, non-reflective bronze, etched with symbols that
squirmed under my gaze if I looked at them directly. The glass was not
glass, but something dark and depthless, like a drop of midnight. And
within, the needle was not a needle. It was a sliver of something
bone-white, and it did not point north. It spun in slow, lazy circles,
occasionally twitching as if sniffing the air.</p>
<p>“This is a joke,” I said.</p>
<p>“It’s a map,” she replied. “The only one that matters.”</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Scene 2</strong></p>
<p>“North is a fiction agreed upon by shepherds and kings,” Kaela said.
She had taken the compass back and held it flat on her palm. The white
sliver shuddered, then pointed unerringly at a spot on the barge’s wall
where the moss was particularly thick. “It’s useful for not getting lost
in a forest. Useless for not getting lost in reality.”</p>
<p>She moved her hand slowly in an arc. The sliver pivoted, not
following the movement of her hand, but locking onto the same spot on
the wall, as if drawn by a lodestone.</p>
<p>“A true compass doesn’t care about magnetic north. It points to
<em>potential</em>. To the thin places. The seams.” She walked toward
the wall, the sliver now pointing straight down. She used her boot to
scrape away the moss and rotten wood, revealing the barge’s inner hull.
There was nothing there but more damp, blackened timber. “Look with your
eyes, and you see wood. Look with the compass, and you see a door.”</p>
<p>She placed her free hand against the planks. Not pushing. Just
resting. She closed her flint-coloured eyes. For a long moment, nothing
happened. Then, the air in the barge changed. It wasn’t a wind, but a
pressure, a silent pop in the ears. The candle flame streamed sideways,
then snapped upright again.</p>
<p>And where her hand had been, there was now a… shimmer. A heat-haze
distortion in the shape of a narrow archway. Through it, I didn’t see
the other side of the barge wall. I saw a sliver of a room with walls of
smooth, polished amber, and the scent of ozone and cinnamon washed over
us, brief and shocking, before it faded.</p>
<p>The shimmer vanished. The hull was just a hull.</p>
<p>My mouth was dry. “How?”</p>
<p>“The compass shows you where the walls are thin. The rest is will. A
push in the right direction. A suggestion to reality that it might want
to be something else, just for a moment.” She tossed the compass back to
me. I fumbled it, the cold bronze shocking against my skin. “Your
grandfather could open a pathway wide enough to march a company through,
and stable enough to last a week. I can manage a peephole for three
heartbeats. You, with your head full of other people’s lives? You might
be able to do anything. Or you might tear your own mind apart
trying.”</p>
<p>I looked down at the compass in my hands. The white sliver had
stopped its spinning. It was pointing at me.</p>
<p>“It’s pointing at me,” I said, a chill creeping up my spine.</p>
<p>“It points to the nearest thin place. Right now, that’s you.” She
said it without pity. “Your mind is a crossroads, Emeric. A busy,
poorly-maintained crossroads. The memories are the traffic. This,” she
tapped the compass, “is a surveyor’s tool. It doesn’t judge the road. It
just shows you where it goes.”</p>
<p>For hours, she drilled me. It wasn’t about moving my hands, or saying
words. It was about perception. About feeling the world not as a solid
thing, but as a consensus. A story everyone agrees to tell.</p>
<p>“Feel for the grit in the narrative,” she’d say. “The places where
the tale wears thin. A feeling of <em>elsewhere</em>. A scent that
doesn’t belong. A sound from a room that’s empty.”</p>
<p>I tried. I held the compass, I stared at walls, I strained until my
head ached. I felt nothing but foolish. The only memories that came were
the fool’s—a bawdy limerick about a fishmonger, the precise tension
needed to tune a lute’s third string.</p>
<p>I was about to give up, to tell her this was a mistake, that I was
just a turnip-jester with a broken mind, when I looked at the puddle of
stagnant water by my foot. I wasn’t trying. I was just exhausted. And
for a second, I didn’t see a puddle. I saw a window. I saw a vast, flat
plain of black glass under a green sun, and a lone, spindly figure
walking across it, dragging a shadow ten times its length.</p>
<p>I gasped. The vision vanished. The puddle was just a puddle,
reflecting the rotten barge ribs.</p>
<p>Kaela was watching me, her head cocked. “What did you see?”</p>
<p>“A… a plain. A green sun.”</p>
<p>She nodded, once. “Good. You weren’t looking. That’s the first
lesson. You can’t grab for it. You have to let it notice you.” She
almost smiled. “Like a shy animal. Or a bad memory.”</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Scene 3</strong></p>
<p>The shy animal came for us at dusk.</p>
<p>We were eating a gruel of oats and dried fish, the silence between us
the comfortable kind, worn smooth by exhaustion. The compass lay between
us on the barrel, its sliver pointing steadily at the barge’s eastern
wall—a thin place, Kaela said, that led to a desert of singing sand. She
found it restful.</p>
<p>The first warning was the birds. The constant, dreary chirping of the
Mire-midges stopped, all at once. The silence was thicker than the
fog.</p>
<p>Kaela froze, spoon halfway to her mouth. Her eyes went to the
compass.</p>
<p>The white sliver was no longer pointing east. It was spinning wildly,
erratically, like a panicked thing.</p>
<p>“Out,” she hissed, her voice stripped of all its gravelly calm. “Now.
The back way.”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“Oblivion Guard.”</p>
<p>The name meant nothing to me, but the terror in her voice was a
language I understood perfectly. I scooped up the compass and followed
her as she slithered through a gap in the barge’s stern planking. We
dropped into the icy black water up to our thighs, then slogged through
the reeds onto a hummock of semi-solid ground. She didn’t run. She moved
low and swift, a otter through the muck, gesturing for me to do the
same.</p>
<p>We crouched behind a fallen willow, its trunk a spongy mass of decay.
Through its skeletal branches, I saw them arrive.</p>
<p>There were three. They wore no uniform, but they moved with a
chilling unison that was armour enough. Their clothes were drab, grey,
and perfectly clean, untouched by the Mire’s mud. Their faces were pale,
smooth, and empty. Not blank with concentration, but empty, as if the
features were painted on a canvas stretched over nothing.</p>
<p>One stopped at the entrance to the barge. He didn’t duck. He simply
stood there. Another walked a slow circle around the hull. The third
stood in the centre of the clearing, his head tilted, as if listening to
a tune only he could hear.</p>
<p>The one by the entrance raised a hand. He didn’t speak. He just made
a gentle, wiping motion in the air.</p>
<p>With a sound like a vast sigh, the sunken barge… <em>un-wrote</em>
itself.</p>
<p>It didn’t collapse. It didn’t rot faster. It simply faded, from the
stern forward, into a grey, formless haze, and then into nothing. In
three heartbeats, where a century-old wreck had been, there was only
featureless black peat and still water. No splinters. No moss. Not even
a ripple.</p>
<p>My blood turned to ice in my veins.</p>
<p>The one in the centre turned his head. Slowly. Deliberately. His gaze
swept over the Mire, and it felt like being scraped with a cold blade.
It passed over our hiding place. I held my breath, feeling the fool’s
memory of a card trick—<em>palms wet, smile dry</em>—rise up in a
useless wave of panic.</p>
<p>The empty gaze moved on.</p>
<p>After an eternity, the three figures turned and walked away, their
steps making no sound in the sucking mud. They faded into the grey
twilight, not like men walking into distance, but like ink dissolving in
water.</p>
<p>Only when the midges cautiously resumed their whining did Kaela let
out a shuddering breath.</p>
<p>“The Oblivion Guard,” she whispered, the words hot with hatred and
fear. “They don’t protect the realms. They enforce a quarantine. They
find the thin places, the Wayfinders, the echoes… and they seal them.
Permanently. They think existence should be neat. Separate. One page, no
bleed-through.” She looked at me, her flint eyes blazing. “They are the
reason your grandfather is dead. They are the reason the pathways are
closing. They want a silent, sterile, singular world. And you, with your
head full of other worlds… you are an epidemic to them.”</p>
<p>The compass in my hand was warm. The sliver had stopped spinning. It
pointed, with a terrible certainty, in the direction the grey men had
gone.</p>
<p>“They’re a thin place,” I said, the realization dawning like a
sickness.</p>
<p>“They’re a wound,” Kaela corrected. “A negation. They don’t just
close doors. They brick up the very idea that there ever was a door.”
She pushed herself to her feet. “We can’t stay. They’ll feel the
resonance of what we just did, what we just felt. They’ll be back with
sharper tools.”</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Scene 4</strong></p>
<p>We fled north and east, away from the settled fringes of the Mire,
deeper into its wet, forgotten heart. Kaela moved with a brutal,
unhesitating speed. I stumbled after her, the turnip-fed strength of
Baldric’s farm rapidly evaporating, replaced by a cold, humming
terror.</p>
<p>Just before the last light failed, she led me to a cairn—a heap of
water-smoothed stones piled atop a hummock that was more island than
land. It looked ancient, older than the Mire itself.</p>
<p>“Here,” she said, brushing away lichen from the base of the stones.
She found one that rocked, and with a grunt, pried it aside. From the
dark cavity beneath, she pulled a oilskin pack, heavy and long.</p>
<p>She laid it on the ground and opened it. Inside, wrapped with
meticulous care, were the artifacts of another life. A cloak of a
strange, grey fabric that seemed to drink the light. A waterskin that
felt empty but sloshed when shaken. A knife with a blade of the same
non-reflective bronze as the compass. And a journal, its leather cover
soft and stained.</p>
<p>“His travel pack,” she said, her voice softer now. “He left it here,
the last time I saw him. He said he was going to find a quiet world, one
the Guard hadn’t noticed. A page at the back of the book.” She handed me
the journal. “He said to give you this, when the time came. For
clues.”</p>
<p>I opened it. The handwriting was a frantic, angular scrawl. It was
not a narrative. It was a list. A catalogue of impossibilities.</p>
<p><em>Page 14: ‘The Glass Desert. Gateway: a mirror facing the setting
sun at the equinox. Local time runs sticky. Bring your own
shadow.’</em></p>
<p><em>Page 32: ‘The City of Spires. Gateway: the echo of seven bells
from a sunken church. Beware the scent of copper. They dream with their
eyes open.’</em></p>
<p><em>Page 57: ‘The Whispering Gallery. Gateway: a perfect silence held
for thirteen breaths. Reality is a suggestion here. Do not agree with
the walls.’</em></p>
<p>And on the last written page: <em>‘The Mire. Not a gateway, but a
sieve. A wound that never healed. Memories pool here. The Guard is most
active here. It is the front line. I must go further. Find the Source of
the Bleed. Maybe there, I can find a cure for the noise. For my
grandson. The silence is coming for him, too.’</em></p>
<p>My grandfather’s words. About me. Written before I was born. The
noise in my head. The silence the Guard brought.</p>
<p>I looked up at Kaela. “Where do we go?”</p>
<p>She took the journal, flipped to a page near the front, and pointed.
The entry was brief.</p>
<p><em>‘The Gilded Hollow. Gateway: laughter in a place of dread.
Temporary. Unstable. But close. A pocket of Elsewhere that clings to
this world like a burr. A good place to hide. A better place to remember
how to walk.’</em></p>
<p>Laughter in a place of dread.</p>
<p>The memory-fool’s confidence surged up in me, a warm, defiant tide
against the cold fear. Sir Guy’s banquet. Redgrave Manor. It was a place
of dread for me. And I was supposed to fill it with laughter.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a coincidence. It couldn’t be. The Mire, the memories, the
compass—they were all pointing the same way.</p>
<p>“Redgrave,” I said.</p>
<p>Kaela nodded, re-wrapping the pack with swift efficiency. “The
fastest way to a hidden world is through a door that’s already ajar.
Your performance isn’t just a disguise, Emeric. It’s a key. You will
make them laugh in that hall of stone and fear. And in that moment, when
the dread parts for the joy, the gateway will thin. And we will walk
through.”</p>
<p>She shouldered the pack and handed me the compass. “Your inheritance.
Your map. Your burden.” She looked toward the distant, invisible manor,
her face a mask of grim resolve. “The Guard will be watching the old
pathways. They won’t be watching a lord’s dinner party. We go from
ridiculous to sublime.”</p>
<p>We set off through the gathering dark. The turnip field fool, the
broken sieve, the grandson of a ghost. I carried a compass that pointed
to holes in the world, a head full of strangers, and a lute tune about a
one-legged gull that I now knew, with a certainty that felt like my
first true memory, came from a tavern in a city under a double moon.</p>
<p>The fourth thing I forgot was the meaning of impossibility. And in
that forgetting, I took my first real step.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-5">Chapter 5</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-5-1"><strong>CHAPTER 5</strong></h2>
<p>The fifth thing I forgot was the sky. Not the colour of it, or the
clouds, but the simple, stupid fact of it being <em>up</em>. Directions,
it turned out, were a habit. And habits were the first things to
dissolve.</p>
<p>We found the alleyway behind the tanner’s yard, a slit of darkness
that smelled of urine and old sorrow. The compass in my palm was no
longer a passive, puzzling thing. It hummed, a low thrum that travelled
up the bones of my arm and settled behind my eyes. The needle didn’t
point north. It pointed at the alley’s dead end, a wall of slick, mossy
brick.</p>
<p>“Here,” I said. The word was barely a breath.</p>
<p>Kaela stood beside me, a silhouette against the distant glow of a
tavern sign. She didn’t look at the wall. She looked at me. “The journal
said a ritual. A key of laughter in a place of dread. This,” she
gestured to the reeking dark, the oppressive closeness, “is dread
enough. The laughter must be yours.”</p>
<p>“I’m not feeling particularly humorous.”</p>
<p>“It’s not about humour. It’s about defiance. It’s the fool’s
currency. Spend it.”</p>
<p>I stared at the brick. A place of dread. This alley was one. Redgrave
was another. They were all the same room with different wallpaper. The
cold weight of the Guard’s silence was a dread. The churning chaos of
the memories I couldn’t own was a dread. My grandfather’s prophecy was
the deepest dread of all, a hole waiting at the bottom of
everything.</p>
<p>Laughter rose in my throat, then. It wasn’t joy. It was a release of
pressure, a sharp, barking sound that echoed off the bricks and sounded
like the cough of a dying dog. It was the laugh you make when you’ve
dropped the last plate in the house. It was the laugh of the man in the
turnip field who has just remembered he owns nothing, not even his
name.</p>
<p>It felt like a lie. But it was my lie. And in the claiming of it,
something shifted.</p>
<p>The compass grew warm. The humming intensified, not in my ears, but
in the space between my thoughts, a vibration that made my teeth ache.
The needle began to spin, slowly at first, then a blur of silver. The
air in the alley thickened, tasting of ozone and turned earth.</p>
<p>“Now,” Kaela whispered, her voice tight. “The memory. The one that
doesn’t fit. The one that feels like a splinter. Push it toward the
wall.”</p>
<p>I didn’t have to choose. One shouldered its way to the front: the
scent of salt and rust, the feel of cold, wet metal under my palms, the
dizzying lurch of a deck that was not a deck. A memory of being on a
great, silent ship under a greenish sky. A memory that belonged to a man
called Alaric, a sailor who’d drowned in a storm of forgetting twenty
years before I was born.</p>
<p>I didn’t remember Alaric’s death. I remembered his loneliness. The
specific, granular loneliness of watching a coastline you don’t
recognise recede into the mist. I took that feeling, that sharp, foreign
shard of a life that was not mine, and I offered it to the wall.</p>
<p>The bricks did not move. They became insubstantial. Not like mist,
but like a thought you can almost grasp—there, but refusing to solidify.
The moss on them glowed a faint, sickly yellow, outlining an archway
that had always been there, waiting for someone to pay the right kind of
attention.</p>
<p>“Go,” Kaela said, and shoved me forward.</p>
<p>I stepped through the idea of a wall.</p>
<hr />
<p>The first thing that happened was the sound. Or the lack of it. The
distant tavern clamour, the scuttle of rats in the alley, the very hum
of the world—it was snipped off, as if by giant shears. The silence was
immense, but it wasn’t the Guard’s silence. That was a suffocating
blanket. This was a held breath.</p>
<p>The second thing was the light. It didn’t come from above. It came
from everywhere. It pooled on the ground, dripped from leaves, clung to
the air itself like luminous dust. I looked up.</p>
<p>There was no sky. There was a ceiling of roots. Gnarled, ancient,
thicker than castle towers, they twisted and wove together high above in
a tangled vault. From them hung vines that shimmered with their own
soft, blue-white radiance. And from those vines, or perhaps from the
roots themselves, grew the trees.</p>
<p>They were wrong. Their trunks were a deep, resonant black, like
polished obsidian. But their leaves… their leaves were crystal. Not
crystal-like. Crystal. Clear, faceted quartz that caught the drifting
light and shattered it into rainbows that danced across the black bark
and the mossy, glowing forest floor. They didn’t rustle. They chinked,
softly, a sound like a thousand tiny wine glasses touching in a
toast.</p>
<p>I was standing in a forest of jewelled chandeliers, grown wild.</p>
<p>I took a step forward. My foot sank into the moss, which released a
puff of silver spores that hung in the air, turning slowly. The ground
was soft, springy. It felt like walking on a lung.</p>
<p>Kaela stepped through behind me. I heard her sharp intake of breath,
the only human sound in that crystalline symphony. The archway of
insubstantial brick wavered, like a reflection in a pond, and then it
was simply gone. There was only more forest, the obsidian trees standing
in a perfect, endless colonnade.</p>
<p>“The Gilded Hollow,” she said, her voice hushed. It didn’t echo. The
sound was swallowed by the soft, absorbing world.</p>
<p>I looked at the compass. The needle had gone limp, pointing at my own
feet. Useless. My inheritance. My map. My burden. It had brought us to
the doorstep and now considered its job done.</p>
<p>“It’s… beautiful,” I said. The word was inadequate. It was the kind
of beauty that precedes a predator. It was too perfect, too silent, too
willing to show you its jewels.</p>
<p>“It’s Elsewhere,” Kaela corrected, kneeling to touch the moss. It
retracted from her fingers slightly, a shy, intelligent movement. “The
rules are different here. Don’t assume anything. Gravity. Time. The need
to breathe. Assume nothing.”</p>
<p>As if on cue, my body decided to test the first rule. I took a deeper
breath. The air was cool and thin, with a faint, sweet taste, like honey
and stone. It filled my lungs but didn’t quite satisfy. It was like
drinking light.</p>
<p>“Which way?” I asked.</p>
<p>Kaela stood, brushing the silver spores from her trousers. She
consulted my grandfather’s journal, holding it close to a dangling vine
for light. “He writes that the Hollow is a ‘pocket’. Finite. It has a…
texture. A grain. Memories flow along certain paths here. We need to
find the current.”</p>
<p>“The current of memories.”</p>
<p>“Your memories,” she said, looking at me. “Or the ones you carry.
They are our lodestone now. Think of Alaric. The sailor. Walk.”</p>
<p>I tried. I held the splinter of Alaric’s loneliness and began to walk
between the glittering trees. The crystal leaves chimed as we passed,
though there was no wind. It felt less like walking through a forest and
more like walking through the skeleton of one, a fossilised idea of a
wood made precious and strange.</p>
<p>After a dozen steps, I realised the third forgotten thing: the
feeling of up and down. It wasn’t that I was dizzy. It was that the
concept itself was becoming negotiable. The light came from all
directions, the trees grew straight out of the soft, breathing ground,
but my inner ear began to whisper that <em>down</em> might be slightly
to the left. Or perhaps behind that particularly large trunk. It was a
subtle, insistent wrongness, like a word on the tip of your tongue that
refuses to be spoken.</p>
<p>Kaela felt it too. I saw her reach out to steady herself against a
tree, her hand flinching back at the cold, smooth touch of the obsidian.
“The gravity is… local,” she muttered. “Tied to objects, not to the
ground. Don’t jump.”</p>
<p>The warning came too late for my own body’s curiosity. I saw a
low-hanging crystal leaf, a beautiful spear of clear quartz, and I
reached up to touch it. My movement was too eager, too much of the old
world. I pushed off with my feet.</p>
<p>The world pivoted.</p>
<p>The mossy ground was no longer beneath me. It was on my right, a
vertical wall of glowing green and silver. The tree I had been standing
next to was now a horizontal pillar stretching away from me. Kaela was a
bizarre figure standing sideways on the vertical forest floor, her hair
hanging loose toward the new ‘down’—which was a dense patch of luminous
fungi on the trunk of a distant tree.</p>
<p>I flailed, a slow, dreamlike tumble. There was no rush of air, no
gut-dropping plunge. It was a lazy, graceful reorientation. The local
gravity of the tree I’d pushed off from had released me, and I was now
in the gentle, insistent pull of the giant fungal patch. I drifted
towards it, spinning slowly.</p>
<p>“Emeric!” Kaela’s voice was strained. She was fighting to move, each
step a deliberate, gluey effort as she navigated the shift in
perspective. She looked like a fly walking on a ceiling.</p>
<p>I hit the fungi. It was soft, like damp velvet, and it clung. I was
now standing, perfectly comfortably, on the side of the tree trunk,
looking across the forest at Kaela, who stood perpendicular to me. The
world was a child’s toy box, shaken and spilled.</p>
<p>“Assume nothing,” I gasped, the lesson now written in my bones.</p>
<p>It took us an hour to figure it out. To move, you had to commit to
the gravity of the object you were on. To change course, you had to find
a point where the gravitational fields bled into each other—a patch of
moss that climbed from the floor to a root, a vine that connected two
trees. It was a logic of connection, not of landscape. You didn’t walk
<em>to</em> a place. You walked <em>with</em> it.</p>
<p>My Alaric-memory was no help. His loneliness was a vast, flat
horizon, a grey sea. This was a labyrinth of upended perspectives. We
moved like drunkards, like slow-motion acrobats, clinging to vines and
shuffling across impossible angles.</p>
<p>I was standing on a thick, horizontal root, studying a cluster of
crystal leaves that seemed to pulse with a slower light, when I felt it.
A tug. Not in my body, but in the clutter of my mind. It was a specific
memory, one of the quieter ones: a woman’s hands, stitching a sail by
candlelight. Her hands were rough, needle-pricked, but the stitches were
perfect, tiny, relentless. Her name was Elara. She was Alaric’s wife.
The memory was one of waiting. Not lonely waiting. Faithful waiting. The
deep, quiet certainty that the horizon would bring something home.</p>
<p>This memory didn’t hurt. It was a warm stone in a cold stream. And it
was pulling me. Not along the root, but <em>down its length</em>, toward
the vast, gnarled trunk it sprang from.</p>
<p>“This way,” I said, my voice full of a wonder I didn’t
understand.</p>
<p>I began to walk along the root, which was as wide as a country path.
Kaela followed, her movements growing more confident as she learned the
Hollow’s rules. The pull grew stronger. Other memories stirred in
sympathy: the taste of hardtack, the smell of tar, the feel of a rope
burning through calloused palms. Alaric’s life, not as a jumble of
shattered glass, but as a stream, finding its bed.</p>
<p>The root led us to the trunk. It wasn’t a tree like the others. It
was the Tree. A central pillar of the world, so vast its curve
disappeared into the luminous gloom. And in its side, where the root met
the trunk, was a hollow. Not a small one. An opening large enough to
ride a carriage through, dripping with phosphorescent moss and soft,
pulsing lichen.</p>
<p>The pull was a drumbeat now. All of Alaric, every stolen shard I
carried, yearned for that opening. It felt like coming home to a house
I’d never seen.</p>
<p>We stood at the threshold. The air from within was warmer, and
carried a smell I knew: salt, and oakum, and slow-moving river
water.</p>
<p>“The current,” Kaela said. “This is it. A confluence of memory. His
memory.”</p>
<p>“What’s inside?” I asked, though I already knew. I could feel the
deck under my phantom feet.</p>
<p>“A place his memory holds onto. A pocket within a pocket. The
strongest memories can shape Elsewhere. They become… real.”</p>
<p>I stepped into the hollow.</p>
<hr />
<p>I was on the deck of <em>The Wayward Son</em>. Not a memory. I was
<em>on it</em>. The wood was solid and salt-weathered under my boots.
The sails above were patched and grey, bellied out with a wind I
couldn’t feel. The sky was a perpetual, bruised twilight, the same
greenish hue from my memory-fragment. The air was thick and still.</p>
<p>But the ship was not on a sea. It was suspended in a cavern of
crystal, its bowsprit pointing into the endless, glittering interior of
the great tree. Below the railing, instead of water, was a slow,
swirling nebula of colours—muted blues, greys, and deep indigos—that
churned in silence. It was the sea of forgetting. The Mire, given
form.</p>
<p>And the ship was crewed.</p>
<p>Figures moved on the deck. They were translucent, like smoke held in
the shape of men. They hauled on ropes that moved nothing, swabbed decks
that were already clean, called orders in silent voices. They were
memories themselves, impressions so strong they had worn grooves in the
fabric of this place. Ghosts of habit.</p>
<p>One figure stood at the wheel, solid-looking, his back to me. He wore
a salt-stained coat, his hair long and tied back. I knew the set of his
shoulders. The stubborn angle of his head.</p>
<p>Alaric.</p>
<p>I walked toward him, the dream-ship solid under me. The spectral crew
paid me no mind. I was a stone in their stream. I reached the
quarterdeck.</p>
<p>“You’re not supposed to be here,” the man at the wheel said. His
voice was rough, real. He didn’t turn. “This is a closed loop. A man’s
final thoughts, going round and round. No room for visitors.”</p>
<p>“I’m not a visitor,” I said. “I’m… carrying you.”</p>
<p>That made him turn.</p>
<p>He had my eyes. Not the colour, but the shape. A family resemblance
that went deeper than blood. It was the look of a man watching a
coastline disappear. He was younger than my grandfather, but older than
my father would have been. A man in his prime, frozen at the moment of
his unravelling.</p>
<p>He stared at me, and his face moved through confusion, anger, and a
terrible, dawning pity. “Ah,” he said, the word a sigh of understanding.
“You’re the sieve. The grandson.”</p>
<p>“You knew my grandfather.”</p>
<p>“Ivar? Knew him? He was the rock the storm broke against. He tried to
warn me. ‘The memories are not a treasure,’ he said. ‘They are a weight.
They will anchor you to the bottom.’” Alaric gestured at the swirling,
colour-churned abyss below the ship. “I didn’t listen. I gathered them
like a magpie. Every port, every face, every loss. I thought it made me
rich. I thought it made me <em>remember</em>. But it just made me a
bigger target for the silence.”</p>
<p>He looked at me, and his gaze was a physical weight. “And now you
carry my shipwreck. A piece of my anchor. Does it hurt?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Good. That means you’re still fighting. The day it doesn’t hurt is
the day you’ve drowned.” He turned back to his wheel, facing the
glittering cavern wall. “You can’t stay. This loop is decaying. Even
Elsewhere can’t hold a perfect moment forever. The ship is sinking. It
just takes a long, long time.”</p>
<p>“I need to know how to navigate this place,” I said. “The Hollow.
We’re looking for a way to understand. To stop the Guard.”</p>
<p>Alaric barked a laugh, a dry, cracking sound. “The Guard are just the
symptom. The world is getting thinner. The memories are leaking out
because there are too many of them, and not enough people who know how
to hold them lightly. You want to navigate? Stop trying to walk on the
land.” He finally looked at me again, his eyes fierce. “You’re a sailor
now, boy. On a sea of lost things. Don’t follow paths. Follow the
currents. The pain is the current. The longing is the current. Let it
pull you. It’s the only map that matters here.”</p>
<p>He nodded past me. I turned. Kaela stood by the rail, watching the
spectral crew. She looked solid, real, a nail holding this reality
fast.</p>
<p>“She’s your anchor to the <em>now</em>,” Alaric said. “Clever. You
have Ivar’s knack for finding strange tools. Hold onto her. Without an
anchor, the current will take you apart, scatter you into the Mire like
the rest of us. Now go. My loop is tired. I want to watch the false
horizon in peace.”</p>
<p>The dismissal was absolute. I was an interruption in his private,
endless shipwreck. I felt Alaric’s memories inside me settle, as if they
had been acknowledged by their source. They didn’t hurt less. They just…
belonged. They were no longer splinters. They were chapters in a book I
hadn’t written, but was learning to read.</p>
<p>I walked back to Kaela. As we reached the gangway leading back to the
hollow entrance, the world shuddered. A deep, grinding groan echoed
through the crystalline cavern. A crack, sharp as lightning, split the
mainmast of <em>The Wayward Son</em> from top to bottom. The spectral
sailors didn’t look up. They just kept swabbing, hauling, staring into
the silent twilight.</p>
<p>Alaric didn’t turn. He gripped his wheel, facing the nothingness with
a straight back.</p>
<p>We stepped off the ship and onto the moss of the hollow. As we did, I
looked back. The entrance shimmered, like a heat haze. Through it, I saw
the ship, the crew, the brave, foolish man at the wheel. Then the image
folded in on itself, like a letter being sealed. There was a soft
<em>pop</em> of pressure, and the hollow in the tree was just a hollow
again, dark and empty.</p>
<p>Alaric’s loop was gone. Sunk. The memory had finished dying.</p>
<p>I stood there, breathing the sweet, thin air of the Hollow, and I
felt a new, vast emptiness inside me. It wasn’t the absence of memory.
It was the absence of <em>him</em>. A space where a man’s entire ended
world had been, moments before. I had not just carried his memory. I had
been its witness. And now I was its tomb.</p>
<p>Kaela touched my arm. “Emeric.”</p>
<p>I looked at her. Her face was etched with the same awe and
sorrow.</p>
<p>“The gateway,” she said, her voice barely audible. “The one we came
through. It’s tied to a place of dread in our world. When we left that
place, when we entered the current here… the connection severed.”</p>
<p>I understood. I turned and looked back the way we had come. There was
no archway of brick. No alley. No tanner’s yard. Only the endless,
beautiful, predatory forest of crystal and shadow.</p>
<p>We were not visiting Elsewhere.</p>
<p>We were trapped in it.</p>
<p>The fifth thing I forgot was the way home. And in that forgetting,
the world became very, very large, and I became very, very small. The
current my great-uncle Alaric spoke of tugged at me, not from ahead, but
from below. As if the very floor of the Gilded Hollow was just another
sea, waiting to swallow another ship.</p>
<p>And in the profound, chiming silence, I heard a new sound. Not the
gentle <em>chink</em> of crystal leaves. This was a rhythmic, deliberate
crunch. Something large, moving through the moss. Walking with a gravity
all its own.</p>
<p>It was coming toward us.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-6">Chapter 6</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-6-1"><strong>CHAPTER 6</strong></h2>
<p>The sixth thing I forgot was the colour of a safe sky. The sky here
was not a sky at all, but a vault of stained glass, held together by the
black sinews of ancient branches. It was beautiful the way a knife is
beautiful: all cold purpose and sharp edges. The sound of crunching moss
grew louder. It was the sound of a careful mouth.</p>
<p>Kaela’s hand tightened on my arm. Leo had already moved, stepping in
front of us both, his body a tense line. He didn’t draw a weapon. He
just stood there, listening, his head cocked like a hound catching a
scent. The profound silence of the Hollow had been a lie. It was just
the pause between notes.</p>
<p>From between two trees whose trunks were woven like braided silver,
it emerged. It was not an animal. It was a collection of ideas about
movement. A central mass of something like dark, polished horn hovered a
hand’s breadth above the moss, from which six long, jointed legs of
crystalline thorn descended. They didn’t touch the ground. They
<em>pressed</em> upon it, each step leaving a faint, phosphorescent
imprint that faded like a dying breath. It had no face. The front of the
horn-mass was smooth, save for a vertical seam that opened and closed
with a soft, wet <em>click</em> with every crunching step. It was
harvesting. Not us. Not yet. Its legs swept through banks of the glowing
moss, and where they passed, the light was siphoned away, leaving
patches of dull grey felt.</p>
<p>“Don’t move,” Leo breathed. “It’s a Gleaner. It maps by
disturbance.”</p>
<p>His words were a theory. The Gleaner was a fact. It stopped its
methodical sweeping. The vertical seam stopped its clicking. It oriented
its blank front towards us. The air grew heavier, tasting of ozone and
damp stone.</p>
<p>Then the moss at our feet erupted.</p>
<p>It wasn’t an attack from the Gleaner. It was a reaction to us, to our
foreign heat, our wrongness. Tendrils of what I had taken for soft
ground lashed upward, fibrous and quick as whipcords. One wrapped around
Kaela’s ankle with a sound like tearing velvet. She gasped, more in
surprise than pain, and tried to pull back. Another tendril snaked
towards Leo’s leg.</p>
<p>He moved then. Not away, but into it. He dropped to a crouch, his
hand going to the pouch at his belt. The Gleaner, sensing the violent
motion, let out a low hum that vibrated in my teeth. It began a slow,
deliberate advance, its legs pressing deeper, sinking into the moss as
if it were water.</p>
<p>“Emeric, the compass!” Leo barked, his fingers closing not around a
weapon, but around the old, brass compass. He didn’t open it. He held it
flat on his palm, his thumb rubbing a frantic, specific pattern on its
case.</p>
<p>The tendril around Kaela’s ankle tightened, pulling. I stumbled
forward, not with a plan, but with the simple, stupid momentum of not
wanting to be alone. I brought my boot down on the tendril. It gave with
a fibrous crunch, leaking a sap that smelled of fermented honey. The
Gleaner’s hum pitched higher.</p>
<p>Leo was chanting something, a string of syllables that had the rhythm
of a lullaby and the edge of a shard of glass. The compass in his hand
began to glow, not with light, but with a kind of visible warmth, a
distortion in the air above it like heat from a sun-baked stone. He
thrust his arm out, sweeping it in a slow arc between us and the
advancing Gleaner.</p>
<p>The effect was immediate and wrong. The world didn’t change. Our
place in it did. It was like we had all taken a single step sideways out
of a painting. The tendrils recoiled, not as if burned, but as if they
had suddenly forgotten what they were holding. They slid back into the
moss, which now lay inert and ordinary around our feet. The Gleaner
stopped. Its seam clicked open, closed, open. It was no longer looking
at us. It was looking <em>through</em> us, at the space where we had
been a moment before. After a long, humming moment, it turned with a
terrible, graceful slowness and resumed its harvesting of the light,
crunching away into the crystalline undergrowth.</p>
<p>The silence returned, thicker now, pregnant with our heartbeat.</p>
<p>“What did you do?” Kaela whispered, rubbing her ankle.</p>
<p>Leo slumped, the compass’s glow fading. He looked pale. “It’s a
Wayfinder’s trick. A minor misdirection. It doesn’t hide you. It
convinces the world you’re… background. Unimportant. Like convincing a
book you’re a footnote.” He looked at the compass, his expression grim.
“It drains the charge. We have maybe one more use before it’s just a
souvenir.”</p>
<p>I looked from the compass to the grey, dead patches the Gleaner had
left behind. A map of absence. “We can’t stay here.”</p>
<p>“No,” Leo agreed, his voice regaining its gravel. “We need bearings.
A path. This,” he gestured at the endless, beautiful forest, “is a
stomach. We are the meal, waiting to be digested.”</p>
<p>We moved, driven less by courage than by the simple, animal need to
be somewhere else. The forest shifted around us. At times, the crystal
leaves chimed a gentle, wind-chime melody. At others, they were silent
as held breath. We saw things. A pool of liquid shadow that reflected
not our faces, but scenes from what might have been our childhoods—a
blur of a kitchen for me, a flash of a loom for Kaela. Leo looked away
quickly. We passed a tree whose bark was covered in slowly shifting
runes that told a story I could almost understand, about a king who
forgot his kingdom and in doing so, saved it. The air grew colder.</p>
<p>After what felt like hours, or minutes—time here was a sticky
substance, not a river—the trees began to thin. We emerged onto the
shore of a vast, still lake. The water was a perfect mirror, doubling
the fractured sky. And on its shore, beached like a giant, dead insect,
was a sky-skiff.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful, broken thing. Its hull was made of a pale,
lightweight wood, and its wings—tattered sails of some silvery
membrane—were folded awkwardly against its sides. A complex arrangement
of brass pipes and crystalline reservoirs along its flank was clearly
shattered. A man was hunched over one of the broken pipes, his back to
us, muttering curses with a creative, heartfelt sincerity.</p>
<p>He heard our approach and whirled, a wrench held like a club. He was
lean, with a face that had been weathered by more than one kind of wind.
His eyes were the colour of the lake, grey and assessing. He wore a
patched coat of no particular colour, and his hair was a wild thatch of
brown shot through with silver. He looked us up and down, his gaze
lingering on Leo’s cloak, on the pouch that held the compass.</p>
<p>“Well,” he said, lowering the wrench. His voice was a dry rasp, like
pages turning. “Either you’re the answer to a prayer I didn’t bother
making, or you’re the last garnish on my disaster. Which is it?”</p>
<p>“We’re lost,” I said. The truth felt like the only currency we
had.</p>
<p>“Aren’t we all,” the man sighed, tossing the wrench into the skiff
with a clatter. “Name’s Finn. And this,” he patted the broken hull with
a mixture of affection and disgust, “is the <em>Maybe Tomorrow</em>. A
prophet, she is. Always promising tomorrow, never quite managing
today.”</p>
<p>“You’re stranded,” Leo stated.</p>
<p>“Perceptive. Storm of crystallized emotion, a few leagues spinward.
Sheered the primary flux-conduit. I’ve got the spare, but the housing’s
cracked. Need a second set of hands with a steady grip and a disregard
for minor burns.” He eyed Leo again. “You’ve got the look of a man who’s
held hot things.”</p>
<p>“What’s in it for us?” Kaela asked, practical as ever.</p>
<p>Finn grinned, a lopsided affair that revealed a missing canine. “A
guide. You’re fresh through a gate, yeah? Still have the stink of mortal
earth on you. You won’t last a night out here without knowing the rules.
I get my skiff airworthy, I take you to the nearest settlement.
Glimmerhold. It’s a rat’s nest, but it’s a dry rat’s nest with walls.
And,” he added, his eyes sharpening, “they have a thing or two there
that might interest a Wayfinder. And his… companions.”</p>
<p>The trade was made without another word. Leo and Finn set to work on
the broken conduit, a dance of hissed instructions, glowing solder, and
the smell of scorched metal. Kaela and I stood watch. I watched the
lake. Its perfect mirror-surface was unnerving. I saw no fish, no
ripples. Just our reflection, staring back at us from a world that was
exactly as deep as this one, and just as empty.</p>
<p>As Finn predicted, Leo’s hands were steady. Within the hour, there
was a final <em>click</em> and a low, healthy hum from the skiff’s
crystal array. Finn let out a whoop and clapped Leo on the back.
“There’s life in the old girl yet!”</p>
<p>The journey in the sky-skiff was a lesson in terror and wonder. It
didn’t so much fly as persuade the air to hold it up. We skimmed over
the canopy of the Gilded Hollow, the crystal forest spreading beneath us
like a shattered jewel-box. Finn pointed out landmarks—a river of
slow-moving amber he called the Sap-Flow, a spire of pure black rock
that was a “memory-geode, best left unopened.” He talked constantly, a
stream of information, anecdote, and warning.</p>
<p>“Glimmerhold,” he shouted over the wind of our passage, pointing
ahead to a cluster of lights nestled in the crook of a gargantuan,
fossilized branch. “Built in the shell of a World-Tree bud that never
bloomed. Safe enough, if you watch your purse and your pronouns. The
Oblivion Guard’s been making friends lately.”</p>
<p>Leo’s head snapped up. “Here?”</p>
<p>“Everywhere,” Finn said, his joviality fading. “Whispering in ears.
Trading promises of ‘clean, quiet minds’ and ‘an end to the chaos of
memory.’ Turning folk against Wayfinders, against gate-walkers, against
anyone who traffics in the messy business of otherwheres. They say the
Guard are just the advance scouts. That something bigger is coming. A
tide of quiet.”</p>
<p>Glimmerhold was a shock of noise and smell after the hollow’s
pristine silence. It was a vertical town, built in tiers within the
vast, woody hollow of the fossil bud. Lanterns glowed with captured
crystal-light. The air smelled of strange spices, forge-smoke, and the
underlying, sweet-rot scent of the ancient wood. Faces of every
description turned to watch us as Finn led us through the winding,
ramshackle streets. There were people with skin the colour of moss or
polished copper, eyes that held extra lids, voices that chimed. And
there were others, like us, who looked vaguely out of place, their
clothing subtly wrong, their eyes holding a familiar, hunted confusion.
Refugees from forgotten doors.</p>
<p>We saw the Oblivion Guard’s influence in the posters nailed to the
woody walls. They were simple, stark things. A closed eye. The words:
<strong>STABILITY. PURITY. THE QUIET ORDER.</strong> Beneath one,
someone had scrawled “LIARS” in a frantic hand, but the paint was fresh,
covering over something else.</p>
<p>Finn took us to a tavern that was little more than a wide ledge with
a roof, called The Dangling Leaf. He secured us a table in a shadowy
corner. “Stay here. I’ll ask after what you need. A map of the local
currents, yes? To find a stable gate out?”</p>
<p>Leo nodded. “Anything that points to a place called the ‘Tanner’s
Yard’ or shows anchor-points for gates tied to places of… dread.”</p>
<p>Finn’s eyebrows rose. “A heavy anchor. Makes sense why it snapped.”
He melted into the crowd.</p>
<p>We waited. The tavern’s chatter was a low, anxious buzz. I caught
snippets.</p>
<p>“—Guard offered to cleanse my brother’s regret-sickness. He hasn’t
spoken since—” “—the price of dream-silk is through the roof, the
Weavers are too scared to harvest—” “—Wayfinder was run out of the Spire
market yesterday, called a memory-thief—”</p>
<p>Kaela leaned in. “We’re not welcome here.”</p>
<p>“We’re not welcome anywhere,” Leo murmured, his eyes on the door.
“Our only currency is what we know. And we know almost nothing.”</p>
<p>Finn returned, his face grim. He slid onto the bench. “Bad and worse.
The map you need is a fragment. The Cartographer who made it is… gone.
Quieted, likely. His apprentice has the last copy. He’s willing to
barter. But not for coin. He wants a memory. A specific one. From a
specific world.”</p>
<p>“What memory?” I asked.</p>
<p>Finn looked at me. “A taste of true sunlight. Not the refracted,
stained-glass light of the Hollow. The raw, warm, yellow light of a
mortal sun. He’s a connoisseur. Collects sensations from otherwheres.
Says it’s the only pure art left.”</p>
<p>I laughed, a short, hopeless sound. “We don’t have a jar of
sunlight.”</p>
<p>“No,” Leo said slowly. He was looking at me, a strange focus in his
eyes. “But we might have a vessel that held it.” He reached into his own
pack and pulled out the oilskin pouch. From it, he drew the only thing
of my old world I had brought, save the clothes on my back: the smooth,
grey river stone from the bank of the Teme, the one that had felt warm
in my hand the morning I forgot my name. It was just a stone.</p>
<p>“It spent ten thousand years baking under that sun,” Leo said, his
voice low. “It drank the light. It holds the memory of it, in its very
grain. To a collector of sensations… that might be worth more than a
map. It might be a relic.”</p>
<p>He held it out to me. The stone was cool now. It was just a stone.
But in Leo’s eyes, it was a key. I took it. It had a familiar weight.
Like a worn shoe.</p>
<p>The apprentice’s shop was a cluttered cave near the top of
Glimmerhold. The young man himself was pallid, with large, watery eyes
that blinked too rarely. He called himself Silas. He took the stone from
my hand with fingers that trembled slightly. He didn’t look at it. He
held it to his temple and closed his eyes.</p>
<p>For a long minute, he was still. Then a tear traced a path through
the dust on his cheek. “Oh,” he whispered. “The <em>weight</em> of it.
The… benevolent violence.” He lowered the stone, looking at me with
something like awe. “This is from the core-world. The First Template.
Where memory is thick as clay.” He clutched the stone to his chest. “The
fragment is yours.”</p>
<p>The map fragment was not paper, but a sliver of thin, clear crystal.
When held up to the light, delicate, three-dimensional lines glowed
within it, depicting a labyrinth of interlocking branches, currents of
coloured light, and tiny, pulsing anchor-points. One, marked with a
sigil of a dripping hide, pulsed a sickly yellow-green. The Tanner’s
Yard. It was not far, as the Hollow measured distance. But between it
and us was a knot of currents labelled “The Mourning,” and a territory
marked with the closed-eye symbol of the Oblivion Guard.</p>
<p>We had our direction. We had our danger.</p>
<p>Back at The Dangling Leaf, making plans with Finn for a dawn
departure, the hook caught. A man, broad and silent, with a blank,
placid face and eyes the colour of tarnished silver, entered the tavern.
He wore no insignia, but the crowd around him stilled, conversations
wilting in his presence. An Oblivion Guard. His gaze swept the room, a
slow, methodical erasure. It passed over our table, moved on, then
snapped back. It settled on Leo. On the cut of his cloak. On the shape
of the compass beneath the fabric.</p>
<p>He didn’t point. He didn’t shout. He simply turned and walked out,
the crowd parting before him like grass before a scythe.</p>
<p>“Time’s up,” Finn hissed, gathering his things. “He’s gone to fetch
others. They’ll want to have a quiet conversation with your friend. A
permanent one.”</p>
<p>We fled Glimmerhold not by the main thoroughfares, but through the
midden-runs and fungal pipelines, Finn leading the way with a rat’s
instinct. We emerged into the cold, chiming dark of the forest, the
settlement’s lights a distant, hostile constellation behind us.</p>
<p>“I can take you as far as the edge of The Mourning,” Finn panted,
leaning against a tree of twisted jet. “After that, my contract with the
<em>Maybe Tomorrow</em> says I value my own hull more than your hides.
No offence.”</p>
<p>“None taken,” Leo said, his face a mask in the gloom. “You’ve done
more than enough.”</p>
<p>We camped in the hollow of a great root, taking watches. My watch was
the last, the time when the Hollow’s false sky began to lighten with a
thousand fractured dawns. I sat with the map fragment in my hand, the
crystal cool against my skin. I thought of Alaric, facing his end at the
wheel of his memory-ship. I thought of the stone, now in the hands of a
stranger, carrying the ghost of a sun I could no longer properly recall.
I was trading away the pieces of where I’d been to learn how to get
back. I was bartering with my own forgetting.</p>
<p>The seventh thing I forgot was why I was fighting so hard to return.
The memory of home was a silhouette now, all outline and no detail. A
space waiting to be filled with something else. The current my
great-uncle spoke of tugged at me, stronger now. It wasn’t just below.
It was <em>in</em> me. A slow, sure pull towards a different kind of
quiet.</p>
<p>As the first chime of the crystal leaves began the day’s song, I saw
it. At the edge of the clearing, where the moss met the root-wall. A
single, perfect footprint. Not Finn’s, not Leo’s, not Kaela’s. It was
long, narrow, pressed deep into the soft ground. And from its heel, a
faint, phosphorescent glow was fading, like a dying breath.</p>
<p>It was the print of a thorned, crystalline leg.</p>
<p>The Gleaner hadn’t lost us. It had just been waiting for its note to
play. And in the cold, coloured light of the new Hollow day, I realized
the truth: we weren’t navigating this world. We were being arranged by
it. We were the symposium now, and the root vegetables were
listening.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-7">Chapter 7</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-7-1"><strong>CHAPTER 7</strong></h2>
<p>The eighth thing I forgot was the taste of fear. Not the feeling—that
was a constant, sour companion—but the specific flavour of it. Was it
metallic, like a bitten tongue? Or empty, like a dry swallow? The memory
of the sensation had been replaced by the thing itself, and it had no
taste at all. It was just a hollow space where a memory should be,
echoing with the chime of crystal leaves.</p>
<p>We followed the footprint. It was less a choice and more a
concession, like agreeing to follow the only path off a cliff. The
Gleaner’s trail was a series of faint, glowing punctures in the moss,
leading away from our root-hollow and into a deeper, older part of the
forest. The trees here were not just jet, but veined with something that
pulsed a slow, deep violet, like a bruise seen through skin.</p>
<p>“The edge of The Mourning is that way,” Finn said, pointing with his
chin to the left. His voice was a low rasp. The footprint trail led
straight ahead, into a narrowing gully of rock. “My contract is
itching.”</p>
<p>“The map agrees with the footprint,” Kaela said, holding the fragment
up. The lines etched on the crystal seemed to swim in the faint light,
aligning with the gully’s mouth. “The canyon it shows… the entrance is
here. The Echoing Canyon.”</p>
<p>Leo looked from the map to the gully, his face still that careful
mask. “So our guide and our destination have converged. Convenient.”</p>
<p>“Or orchestrated,” I said. The words from the dawn came back. <em>We
were being arranged.</em> “Do we have a better option?”</p>
<p>Finn spat on the moss. It sizzled faintly. “Options are a luxury for
people with hulls in friendly ports. You have a path and a predator. I’d
take the path. From a distance.” He shifted his pack. “This is my stop.
The <em>Maybe Tomorrow</em> won’t wait forever, and a captain’s first
marriage is to his ship.”</p>
<p>He didn’t offer a hand. We didn’t offer thanks. There was a
transaction complete in the air between us, settled and dusted. He gave
a curt nod, more to the forest than to us, and melted back into the
twisted trees, his form blurring into the shadows as if he’d never been
there. A man made of exit strategies.</p>
<p>The three of us were left with the gully, the map, and the glowing
footprints.</p>
<p>“Symposium with the root vegetables it is, then,” Leo murmured, and
stepped forward.</p>
<p>The gully was a wound in the world. The walls were not stone, but a
compressed, conglomerate memory of stone—all the sharp edges and gritty
textures, but with a give to it, like pressed ash. Our footsteps didn’t
echo so much as they were absorbed, then repeated back a half-second
later in a softer, distorted whisper. <em>Step-crush. Shhh-ep.
Crush-sh.</em></p>
<p>Kaela led, the map fragment held before her like a divining rod. The
canyon did not so much open as unravel, the walls peeling back into a
labyrinth of fissures and overhangs, all of that same absorbent,
grey-black material. Light came from above, but it was the Hollow’s
fractured light, falling in disjointed columns that illuminated swirling
motes of dust that might have been dust, or might have been forgetting
itself, made visible.</p>
<p>The first whisper came as we passed under a low arch of
conglomerate.</p>
<p><em>You left the gate open.</em></p>
<p>It was my mother’s voice. Not as I remembered it, but as it was:
frayed with a worry I’d never understood until I’d misplaced it. It came
from the wall to my left, clear as day. I froze. Leo and Kaela stopped a
few paces ahead, looking back.</p>
<p>“What?” Leo asked.</p>
<p>“You didn’t hear that?”</p>
<p>They shook their heads. Kaela’s eyes were wide, fixed on the map.
“The canyon is echoing. But not our sounds. The crystal is… it’s
warm.”</p>
<p>The second whisper came from my right, from a drip of darker
material. A boy’s voice, cracking on the edge of a laugh. <em>You can’t
even remember the rules, Em. How can you play?</em></p>
<p>A friend. I knew it. A friend whose face was now a smudge, whose name
was a rhythm without letters. The hollow space in me gave a throb.</p>
<p>“It’s pulling from us,” I said, the realization a cold stone in my
gut. “The stone Alaric gave me… it held a memory. This place… it reads
the ones we carry. Or the spaces where they used to be.”</p>
<p>“Lovely,” Leo said, his jaw tight. “A geography of regret.”</p>
<p>We kept moving, deeper into the labyrinth. The whispers became a
chorus, a susurrus of lost fragments. A teacher scolding. A door
slamming. A promise made in a tone that meant it would be broken. They
were not loud, but they were precise, each one a needle finding a
specific, forgotten seam in the soul. I forgot the ninth thing then: the
reason I’d ever thought remembering was a kindness. Forgetting, in that
moment, seemed a vast and merciful silence.</p>
<p>The canyon began to play its tricks in earnest.</p>
<p>We turned a corner and the path ahead was no longer ash-stone, but
the worn floorboards of a farmhouse kitchen. The smell of burnt turnip
and damp wool hung in the air. A figure stood at a stone sink, its back
to us, shoulders slumped. It was my own shape, from behind. I watched as
that other me placed a wooden spade carefully on the table, stared at it
for a long moment, then walked out the far door into a flat, grey field.
The scene had the quality of a memory worn smooth by handling. It was my
last clear moment before the Hollow. The moment of misplacement.</p>
<p>I took a step toward it. The floorboard creaked under my boot—a real,
familiar sound. The figure at the sink did not turn.</p>
<p>“Emeric,” Kaela said, her hand on my arm. Her touch was solid,
present. “It’s a fissure in the wall. Look.”</p>
<p>I blinked. The floorboards were the pattern in the rock, the sink a
weathered jut of stone. The figure was a trick of shadow and longing.
But the smell of burnt turnip lingered for another three breaths, a
ghost in the air.</p>
<p>“It shows you what you’re trying to get back to,” Leo said, his voice
low. “Or what you’re running from. Same thing, often.”</p>
<p>His own test was waiting around the next bend.</p>
<p>Here, the canyon widened into a shallow amphitheatre. The air grew
cold and still. Sitting on a natural plinth of rock was a man. He was
solid, detailed, woven from the very stuff of the canyon. He wore the
severe, high-collared coat of a Port Authority official, his hair
steel-grey and sternly cut. His hands, resting on his knees, were broad
and clean. He looked at Leo with an expression of profound, weary
disappointment.</p>
<p>Leo stopped as if he’d struck a wall.</p>
<p>“Leonidas,” the figure said. Its voice was the canyon’s whisper given
form, dry and resonant. “Still chasing fairy stories.”</p>
<p>“This isn’t real,” Leo said, but the words were for himself, a charm
against the seeing.</p>
<p>“Real enough,” the figure—the illusion of his father—said. It
shifted, and the rock did not grate. It was seamless. “Your grandfather
filled your head with nonsense. Sky-ships. Memory-currents. A great,
gentle purpose. And where did it get him? A footnote in a discredited
log. A shame on the family name you now drag through literal mud.”</p>
<p>Leo’s hands were fists at his sides. “He was right. About all of
it.”</p>
<p>“Was he?” The illusion leaned forward. “Or did he just prefer a
comforting story to a difficult life? He abandoned his post. He left his
duty to rot. He chose a phantom over his own blood. And you… you’ve
traded a commission, a future, for what? To be a vagrant in a cave,
following a man who doesn’t know his own name?” The figure’s eyes
flicked to me, a dismissive glance that felt like a shove. “This is not
navigation. This is delinquency. A final, pathetic symposium.”</p>
<p>I saw the words land. They were not new words. They were old,
familiar weapons, polished by years of use. Leo’s mask cracked. Not into
anger, but into a raw, young pain. The pain of a son who had always
measured himself against a ruler that found him wanting.</p>
<p>He took a shuddering breath. The canyon seemed to hold it, to
wait.</p>
<p>“He didn’t abandon his duty,” Leo said, the words quiet but clear.
“He redefined it. You measure duty in ledgers and dock fees. He measured
it in truths. Uncomfortable, magnificent truths.” He straightened his
shoulders, looking the illusion in its stone-carved eyes. “You called
his stories wild. But they had more integrity than your whole, spotless
career. They were <em>about</em> something. They meant something. This…”
He gestured around the canyon, at Kaela, at me. “This is the ledger now.
And I am balancing it.”</p>
<p>The illusion of his father stared back, its disappointment calcifying
into something colder, final. “Then you are lost, boy.”</p>
<p>“No,” Leo said, a new strength ironing the tremor from his voice.
“I’m found. For the first time. I’m following the current.”</p>
<p>He turned his back on the figure. It was the most defiant thing I’d
ever seen him do. The illusion did not move. It simply began to fade,
the details blurring, the severe coat melting back into the striations
of the rock, the disappointed eyes becoming two dark, empty hollows. It
didn’t vanish with a bang, but with a sigh, the canyon’s whisper
releasing a held breath.</p>
<p>Leo didn’t look at us. He stared at the path ahead, his chest rising
and falling steadily. “Let’s keep moving,” he said. “Before it decides
to conjure my maths tutor.”</p>
<p>Kaela’s turn came in a narrow, high-ceilinged defile. There were no
figures here. Just sound. The air thickened with the roar of engines—not
the steady thrum of the <em>Maybe Tomorrow</em>, but the chaotic,
screaming whine of a ship coming apart. The shriek of tearing metal, the
explosive <em>pop</em> of conduits bursting, and underneath it, a sound
that was worse: a profound, structural groan, the voice of a dying hull.
Then, a clear, calm voice cutting through the chaos on an imagined
comms-channel: “<em>Kaela. Sweetheart. It’s okay. Look at the stars.
Just look at the—</em>”</p>
<p>The sound cut off.</p>
<p>Kaela had gone perfectly still, one hand pressed flat against the
canyon wall. Her eyes were closed. A single tear traced a clean path
through the grime on her cheek. She wasn’t seeing the canyon. She was
back in the cockpit, strapped in, listening to the last lie her co-pilot
ever told her.</p>
<p>The sounds didn’t repeat. They were a one-time gift from the canyon,
a perfect, brutal playback. She opened her eyes, wiped her cheek with a
swift, angry motion, and nodded forward. No words. Some echoes are too
loud for speech.</p>
<p>We moved on, a quieter company. The canyon’s whispers grew more
abstract, less personal. They became the echoes of echoes—the fear of
being late, the sting of a forgotten insult, the vague shape of a joy so
distant its edges had blurred. It was the background noise of a life,
the static of being. And as we walked through it, a strange thing
happened. The hollow spaces in me, the voids where specific memories had
been, began to feel less like wounds and more like… rooms. Empty rooms
in a house I was still learning to navigate. The current my great-uncle
spoke of, that pull towards a different quiet, flowed through those
rooms. It didn’t fill them. It just moved through, acknowledging the
space.</p>
<p>The labyrinth began to constrict again, the walls pressing in, the
ceiling lowering. We were forced to walk single file, then to crouch.
The whispers faded, replaced by a new sound: a deep, sub-aural hum that
vibrated in the teeth and the marrow. The map fragment in Kaela’s hand
was glowing with a steady, azure light.</p>
<p>The tunnel ended abruptly.</p>
<p>We crawled out onto a ledge, and the world fell away.</p>
<p>The Echoing Canyon wasn’t a canyon at all. It was a throat. And we
were standing on its uvula, looking down into the belly of the
realm.</p>
<p>The central chamber was a cavern so vast its edges were lost in a
haze of distance and its own faint, bioluminescent mist. The ceiling,
miles above, was a dome of living crystal, from which hung great,
slow-dripping stalactites that glowed from within with a soft, golden
light. The floor, far below, was a forest of corresponding stalagmites,
a silent, stone city. The air hummed with that profound, quiet
frequency. It was the sound of deep time, of geological patience.</p>
<p>But it was not the scale that stole the breath. It was what sat in
the center.</p>
<p>Spanning the gap between two of the largest stalagmites was a
Gateway. It made the one we’d passed through on the <em>Maybe
Tomorrow</em> look like a child’s drawing. Its ring was carved from a
single, continuous band of a material that was neither stone nor metal,
but something that held the deep, resonant black of a night without
stars. Etched into its surface were not the familiar, sharp sigils of
active gates, but scenes—vast, intricate, and utterly still. I could
make out forests of unfamiliar trees, mountains that curved like claws,
rivers that flowed upwards into clouds.</p>
<p>The Gateway was dormant. Utterly, completely still. No light swirled
in its centre. Instead, the space within the ring held a perfect,
mirror-like reflection of the cavern behind us, inverted and impossibly
deep. It was a closed eye. A locked door.</p>
<p>And at its base, arranged with a terrible, geometric precision, were
hundreds of thorned, crystalline legs. They were not attached to
anything. They stood upright, like a thicket of spears plunged into the
stone, each one glowing with that same faint, dying phosphorescence. A
graveyard of Gleaner limbs. A silent choir.</p>
<p>“God’s teeth,” I breathed. The words felt borrowed, but they fit.</p>
<p>We picked our way down a spiraling natural ramp, our smallness
becoming a profound and humbling truth. The hum was a physical pressure
here. It was in everything. By the time we reached the cavern floor, the
silence within the hum was absolute. Our footsteps were swallowed whole.
We walked through the forest of stalagmites toward the great dormant
ring, like ants approaching a cathedral arch.</p>
<p>Up close, the scale was ludicrous. The Gateway’s lower curve soared
over us, a black rainbow against the glowing gold of the cavern. The
carved scenes were larger than houses, the details finer than any tool
could make. They seemed less carved and more <em>grown</em>, as if the
Gateway had formed around the memories of other places.</p>
<p>Kaela held up the map fragment. Its light had died. It was just a
piece of crystal again. “This is it. The heart. The map… it ends
here.”</p>
<p>Leo walked up to one of the standing crystalline thorns. He didn’t
touch it. “A toll booth,” he said softly. “Or a warning. They followed
us, or they followed everyone who comes here. And they… waited. Until
they became this.”</p>
<p>I looked at the forest of legs, then up at the vast, closed eye of
the Gateway. The current inside me was not tugging now. It was still. A
deep, placid pool. This was the place it had been pulling me toward.
This quiet. This immense, sleeping potential.</p>
<p>“It’s not a way home,” I said, the understanding unfolding like a
cold flower in my chest. “It’s the place all the ways come from. Or go
to. It’s the… source.”</p>
<p>“Then how do we wake it?” Kaela asked, her voice small against the
enormity.</p>
<p>A new sound answered. Not a whisper. Not a hum.</p>
<p>A <em>click</em>.</p>
<p>It came from above. We looked up.</p>
<p>High up on the inner curve of the Gateway’s ring, something moved. It
detached itself from the black material, uncurling with a series of
precise, crystalline clicks. It was a Gleaner. But not like the
fragments we’d seen. It was whole. Its body was a central spindle of
interlocking, faceted segments, from which eight long, thorned legs
articulated with a dancer’s awful grace. It had no head, only a cluster
of faintly glowing crystals at its front where a head might be. It moved
upside down, clinging to the underside of the arch.</p>
<p>It did not scramble. It <em>processed</em>. One leg after another,
placing each thorned tip with infinite care, it began to descend the
vertical face of the Gateway, coming directly toward us. It was in no
hurry. It had been waiting. This was its note to play.</p>
<p>It reached the floor ten paces from us and settled, its legs folding
beneath its spindle-body. The crystal cluster at its front pulsed with a
soft, blue light. It made no other move. It simply… observed.</p>
<p>The tenth thing I forgot was how to breathe.</p>
<p>Then, from the crystal cluster, a voice emerged. It was a composite
sound, woven from the canyon’s whispers, from the hum of the cavern,
from the chime of leaves and the sigh of forgotten things. It was every
echo, given a single purpose.</p>
<p>It spoke my name.</p>
<p>“Emeric,” it said. And the voice was my own.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-8">Chapter 8</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-8-1"><strong>CHAPTER 8</strong></h2>
<p>The sound of my own name, spun from stone-echo and dead air, sat in
the cavern like a physical object. It was my voice, but it was the
version of it I heard in my own head—flat, stripped of the warmth that
other people supposedly heard. A memory of a sound, not the sound
itself.</p>
<p>Kaela’s hand found my arm. Her fingers were cold. “Don’t answer it,”
she whispered, the words barely a shape in the thick quiet.</p>
<p>The Gleaner—the whole, terrible, complete Gleaner—did not move. Its
crystalline cluster pulsed, a slow, patient rhythm. A lighthouse for the
shipwrecked. I realized the current inside me was no longer a placid
pool. It was mirroring that pulse. A soft, internal <em>thrum</em> in
time with the light. It wasn’t fear. It was recognition. A tuning fork
finding its note.</p>
<p>“It’s not talking to <em>you</em>,” I said, my own real voice too
loud, too coarse after the echo’s perfection. “It’s talking to the… the
piece. The one I ate.”</p>
<p>“Semantics,” Finn breathed from behind us, his skiff’s engine a
subdued growl. “It knows your name. That’s the part that sings the
reaper’s tune.”</p>
<p>The Gleaner’s front legs unfolded, not in attack, but in a gesture
that was almost courtly. One thorned tip pointed, with infinite
delicacy, at the forest of petrified legs around the base of the
Gateway. Then it swept the tip in a slow arc, encompassing the entire,
silent cavern, the humming walls, the vast, closed eye above us.</p>
<p>The composite voice wove itself again from the air. “All paths
converge. All seekers arrive. The question is not how to wake the
Gateway. The question is what you will pay to pass through.”</p>
<p>Its voice wasn’t just mine now. It was flecked with Kaela’s stubborn
cadence, with Finn’s gravel, with the whisper of the man who’d called me
useless in a turnip field. It was sampling us, building a richer
chord.</p>
<p>“Pay?” Kaela’s grip tightened. “We didn’t come to bargain. We came to
find a way.”</p>
<p>“To find is to bargain,” the Gleaner chimed. “A memory for a
direction. A fear for a foothold. You have already paid. The one called
Emeric carries a fragment of the First Language. A word. That word is a
key. It is also a price.”</p>
<p>The cold flower of understanding in my chest bloomed fully, its
petals edged with frost. The compass wasn’t just pointing. It was
<em>consuming</em>. Every step, every remembered ghost, every flicker of
who I might have been—it was fuel. The Gleaner was the toll-keeper. And
it was presenting the bill.</p>
<p>“What does it want?” Leo’s voice was a low rumble. He had moved to
flank the thing, his axe held loosely, but his knuckles were pale.</p>
<p>“It wants the key used,” I said. The thrum inside me was a pull
again, not toward the Gateway, but toward the Gleaner itself. A
completion. “It wants the Gateway opened. I think… I think that’s what
they all wanted.” I looked at the petrified figures. “They came to ask a
question of the universe. But the answer costs you the thing that made
you ask.”</p>
<p>The Gleaner’s light pulsed, brighter. Agreement.</p>
<p>A new sound cut through the hum. Not a click. Not a chime.</p>
<p>A <em>clang</em>.</p>
<p>Metallic, harsh, and utterly foreign in this place of whispers and
stone. It came from the tunnel we’d entered by.</p>
<p>Then another. And another. A rhythmic, marching percussion.</p>
<p>Finn swore, a short, sharp word that died in the vastness. “The
Oblivion Guard. They’ve tracked the skiff’s resonance. Or the big door
opening.”</p>
<p>The Gleaner did not turn. It did not need to. Its crystal cluster
dimmed, then brightened, as if filing the new data. “The path is chosen
for you,” it said, its voice now laced with the clang of approaching
armour. “Pay the price, or they will collect you as interest.”</p>
<p>The choices assembled themselves in my head, stark and simple as
stones. Face the Guard with a broken skiff, two fighters, and a girl
with a knife. Or walk up to the nightmare insect, offer it the screaming
piece of alien memory in my gut, and open a door to God-knew-where,
probably disintegrating in the process. A philosophical symposium with
root vegetables had been preferable.</p>
<p>“Leo,” I said. “I see them,” he grunted.</p>
<p>From the tunnel mouth, they emerged. Not the ragged, scavenging bands
we’d encountered before. These were a unit. Ten figures in polished,
greyish armour that seemed to drink the cavern’s faint light rather than
reflect it. Their helms were smooth, featureless ovals, save for a
single, vertical slit for vision. They moved in unison, heavy boots
ringing on the stone, heavy-bladed pikes held at identical angles. At
their head was a commander. Their armour was edged in a dull red, and
they carried no pike, only a long, narrow blade at their hip and an aura
of methodical violence that preceded them like a chill.</p>
<p>They fanned out in a practiced semicircle, blocking the tunnel. The
commander’s helm tilted, taking in the Gateway, the petrified forest,
the Gleaner, and finally, us. The voice that issued from the helm was
filtered, metallic, devoid of anything but imperative.</p>
<p>“By edict of the Curator of Forgetting. You are in violation of Codex
Seven: Trespass upon Proscribed Mnemonic Architecture. You will
surrender the artifact you carry and submit to memory-wipe and
reassignment.”</p>
<p>Finn gunned the skiff’s engine. It coughed, sputtered, and let out a
pathetic whine. “She’s not liking the local energy,” he muttered. “It’s
all wrong for her.”</p>
<p>The commander’s hand went to their blade. “Compliance is immediate.
Or you become part of the architecture.”</p>
<p>The Gleaner, forgotten for a moment, spoke again. Its voice was now a
perfect mimicry of the commander’s filtered tones, layered over our own.
“The tax of hesitation is death. The key, Emeric. Use the key.”</p>
<p>The current in me was a riptide. It wanted the Gleaner. It wanted to
complete the circuit. The Oblivion Guard wanted to unmake me. Both roads
ended with me being erased, one way or another. I had a spade in my
hand, and the whole world was a turnip field.</p>
<p>“We fight,” Kaela said, drawing her knife. It looked like a toothpick
against the pikes.</p>
<p>“No,” I said. The word felt strange, but right. “We run. Toward the
Gateway.”</p>
<p>“It’s a wall!” Finn hissed.</p>
<p>“It’s a door,” I said. “And that thing is the lock. Leo, buy us time.
Finn, get the skiff as close to the base as you can. Kaela, with
me.”</p>
<p>I didn’t wait to see if they obeyed. I turned my back on the
advancing Guard and walked toward the waiting Gleaner. The ultimate
clerical error, reporting for duty.</p>
<p>The commander barked an order. The Guard broke into a charge, their
syncopated steps becoming a thunderous roll.</p>
<p>Leo met them. He did not roar. He simply planted his feet in the path
of the tide, hefted his axe, and became a fact. The first Guard to reach
him learned this. The axe swept low, not at the armour, but at the legs.
It connected with a shriek of metal and a crack of bone. The Guard went
down, and Leo stepped over him, already engaging the next.</p>
<p>Finn urged the groaning skiff forward, weaving through the stone
legs. Kaela was at my side, her breath coming fast. “What are you
doing?”</p>
<p>“Paying,” I said.</p>
<p>We stopped before the Gleaner. Up close, it was worse. Its segments
were not stone, but a kind of hardened resin, and trapped within each
facet were tiny, moving shadows—fragments of scenes, of faces, frozen in
silent screams. The memories it had collected.</p>
<p>“The key,” it intoned.</p>
<p>“How?” My mouth was dust.</p>
<p>“Speak the word you carry. The First Word. The Word of Unmaking.”</p>
<p>I didn’t know any First Words. I’d forgotten my own last name. But
the current knew. It rose in my throat, a pressure, a taste of ozone and
static. I opened my mouth, not to speak, but to be spoken through.</p>
<p>A scream of metal and a cry of pain cut the air. Not Leo’s. A
Guard’s. But there were too many. A pike blade scored a line across
Leo’s broad back. He staggered.</p>
<p>“Emeric, now!” Kaela yelled.</p>
<p>The sound that left me was not a word. It was the feeling of a page
tearing. The sensation of a thread snapping. The quiet <em>pop</em> of a
soap bubble vanishing. It had no syllables, but it had meaning, etched
directly onto the air.</p>
<p>The Gleaner’s crystal cluster blazed with blue-white fire. The light
lanced from it, not at me, but at the sealed centre of the Gateway.</p>
<p>For a heartbeat, nothing.</p>
<p>Then, the vast, smooth surface of the Gateway <em>shivered</em>. Like
the skin of a drum. A geometric pattern, impossibly complex, flickered
across its breadth—lines of silver light connecting, dividing,
spiraling. A low, foundational groan vibrated up through the soles of my
boots, into my teeth, into the marrow of my forgotten bones.</p>
<p>The Gateway was waking up.</p>
<p>The Oblivion Guard halted their assault, their featureless helms
tilting upward as one. The commander stared, then snapped their focus
back to us. “Cease! You destabilize a Class-A Mnemonic Hazard!”</p>
<p>The Gleaner unfolded to its full, terrifying height, its legs
splaying like a crown of thorns. “The path is open,” it sang with a
dozen stolen voices. “The price is paid.”</p>
<p>The silver lines on the Gateway pulsed. In its centre, a darkness
deeper than the cavern’s began to swirl, not opaque, but starless. A
vacancy.</p>
<p>“Finn!” I shouted.</p>
<p>The skiff lurched toward us, spitting sparks. Leo disengaged, backing
toward us, his axe keeping two Guards at bay. He was bleeding from his
back and a cut on his brow.</p>
<p>“Go!” he roared.</p>
<p>Kaela and I scrambled onto the skiff’s deck. Finn wrenched the
steering column. “Hold onto your souls, it’s going to be bumpy!”</p>
<p>The commander saw the plan. They drew their narrow blade. It didn’t
gleam; it seemed to absorb light, leaving a trail of deeper shadow in
the air. They moved with a horrifying speed, past their own soldiers,
past Leo, a straight line for the skiff. For me.</p>
<p>The Gateway’s centre was now a vortex of silent, hungry dark. The hum
of the cavern had risen to a deafening whine. Stone dust sifted from the
ceiling.</p>
<p>Finn aimed the failing skiff straight for the heart of the
vortex.</p>
<p>The commander leapt. Not for the skiff, but for the rock face beside
it, using a protruding leg as a foothold, and launched themselves into
the air. They landed on the rear deck with a crash that rocked the small
vessel. The skiff’s engine screamed in protest.</p>
<p>Kaela, closest, reacted. She didn’t stab. She slashed at the cables
and conduits snaking from the skiff’s engine housing. A spray of sparks
and a gush of hot, green coolant erupted. The commander flinched back,
their armour sizzling.</p>
<p>It was the opening Leo needed. He turned from the Guards on the
ground and brought his axe down on the deck between us and the
commander. The wood splintered. The commander, off-balance, grabbed for
a railing.</p>
<p>The skiff crossed the threshold.</p>
<p>The world did not dissolve. It <em>inverted</em>.</p>
<p>The sound cut out. The light bent. The stone legs, the cavern, the
Gleaner, the pursuing Guards—all stretched into long, thin lines of
fading colour, as if seen through a prism pulled apart. The only solid
thing was the dark vortex ahead, and it was no longer ahead. It was
everywhere. We were inside it.</p>
<p>And the skiff was dying. The engine’s scream had been replaced by a
dying wheeze. The lights on its console flickered and went out. We
drifted, powerless, in a silent, directionless void.</p>
<p>The commander regained their footing. They ignored Leo, ignored Finn
who was frantically slapping the dead controls. Their faceless helm
fixed on me. They raised the shadow-blade.</p>
<p>“The artifact,” the filtered voice said. “You are unfit to carry
it.”</p>
<p>Kaela threw herself in front of me. It was a brave, stupid, beautiful
thing to do. The commander’s free hand shot out, not with a blow, but
with a clamp of armoured fingers around her arm. They yanked her toward
them, spinning her, pulling her back against their chest, the
shadow-blade coming to rest at her throat.</p>
<p>“Or she is unmade,” the commander said. “A simpler tax.”</p>
<p>Leo froze, his axe half-raised. Finn stopped his futile work. The
void pressed in, absolute.</p>
<p>The current inside me was gone. Spent. I had paid my price and was
standing in the empty vault. I had no key, no weapon, no clever plan. I
had a spade, in a field beyond all fields.</p>
<p>I looked at Kaela. Her eyes were wide, but her jaw was set. She gave
a tiny, almost imperceptible shake of her head. <em>Don’t.</em></p>
<p>The commander tightened their grip. “The artifact.”</p>
<p>Then, a flicker. Not in the void, but in the dead console of the
skiff. A single, green light winked on. Then off. Then on again. It was
the resonance scanner. It was picking up something. A geometry that was
not the void.</p>
<p>I looked past the commander, into the nothing. And I saw, not with my
eyes, but with the ghost of the current’s memory, what the Gateway was.
It wasn’t a door to another place. It was a junction. A place where all
possible paths <em>touched</em>. And we were stuck in the glue between
them.</p>
<p>“Leo,” I said, my voice a dry rustle in the perfect quiet. “The
compass.”</p>
<p>He understood. He fumbled the brass disc from his belt. It was
glowing, not with a directed light, but with a chaotic, internal
shimmer, its needle spinning wildly.</p>
<p>“It’s all paths at once,” I said. “It can’t choose. So choose for
it.”</p>
<p>“How?” he growled, his eyes on the blade at Kaela’s throat.</p>
<p>“Think of a place. Any place. Not here.”</p>
<p>Leo stared at the compass, his face a mask of concentration. He was a
man of brute force, of solid things. Abstractions were not his language.
He clenched his fist around the compass, his knuckles white. He thought
of home. Not a place he knew, but the idea of one. A solid ground. A
fixed point.</p>
<p>The compass needle gave a violent jerk. It stopped.</p>
<p>The void around us <em>twitched</em>.</p>
<p>A shard of impossible colour—the deep green of a summer forest—sliced
through the blackness to our left. To our right, a fragment of a
roaring, orange sea. Above, a glimpse of a city of crystal spires. The
Gateway was trying to follow all paths at once. Reality was cracking
like thin ice.</p>
<p>The skiff groaned as conflicting gravities pulled at it. The
commander staggered, their grip on Kaela loosening for a split
second.</p>
<p>It was enough.</p>
<p>Kaela drove her elbow back into the armour’s joint, twisted like an
eel, and dropped below the blade. Leo was already moving. He didn’t
charge the commander. He threw the compass.</p>
<p>It wasn’t an attack. It was a offering. The spinning brass disc flew
through the chaotic air, a tiny, ordered thing in the disorder.</p>
<p>The commander, instinctually, caught it.</p>
<p>The moment the artifact touched their gauntlet, the Gateway reacted.
It was as if a single, screaming note had been fed into the heart of a
silent bell. The prismatic shards of other-wheres collapsed. The void
convulsed.</p>
<p>A single path asserted itself. Not the one Leo had chosen. The one
the commander held in their mind. The one thing every Oblivion Guard was
conditioned to, the core of their being: The Vault of the Curator. The
heart of the Oblivion. The place where all stolen memories were taken to
be dissolved.</p>
<p>The Gateway obliged.</p>
<p>The vortex focused. The darkness ahead solidified into a tunnel of
rushing grey static, lined with flickering, half-seen faces. A highway
of forgetting.</p>
<p>The pull was instantaneous and catastrophic. It was a suction that
came not from the air, but from the substance of our own thoughts. I
felt a lurch, not in my body, but in my mind, as if a drawer full of
precious, fragile things had been yanked open.</p>
<p>The skiff, dead and powerless, was swept into the current. We were
pulled down the grey tunnel, toward a pinprick of sterile, white
light.</p>
<p>The commander, holding the compass that was now locked onto their own
deepest purpose, was the anchor. They stood braced on the deck, a fixed
point in the howling stream.</p>
<p>Leo grabbed Kaela and hauled her toward the relative shelter of the
skiff’s cabin. Finn clung to the steering column. I grabbed a taut
cable, my mind screaming as the static wind tried to peel memories from
me like old wallpaper. The face of the disappointed potato man. The
smell of turnip earth. The weight of the wooden spade. Each one tugged
at, threatening to lift and fly away down the tunnel.</p>
<p>We were hurtling toward the Vault. Toward the end of everything we
were.</p>
<p>The commander watched us, a statue of grim purpose. They had won.
They would deliver the artifact, and us, for unmasking.</p>
<p>Then the Gleaner’s voice filled the tunnel. It was not a composite
now. It was a single, clear, chime of pure frustration. “The tax is
unpaid. The path is corrupted.”</p>
<p>It had not followed us into the void. It was part of the Gateway. And
we were stealing its transaction.</p>
<p>From the walls of the static tunnel, thorned, crystalline legs
<em>pushed through</em>. Not one, but dozens. Fragments, pieces,
half-formed Gleaners, erupting into the pathway like antibodies into a
wound. They scrabbled at the skiff, at the tunnel walls, at the very
fabric of the forced path.</p>
<p>The commander swung their shadow-blade, shearing through a leg. It
dissolved into black sand. But there were more.</p>
<p>The Gateway, stressed by the conflicting commands—the Gleaner’s
intended purpose, the compass’s hijacked destination—began to reject the
imposition.</p>
<p>The grey tunnel flickered. The static became visual noise. The
pinprick of white light swelled, then distorted.</p>
<p>“It’s going to collapse!” Finn yelled, his voice ripped away by the
non-wind.</p>
<p>The Gleaners focused on the source of the corruption: the commander
and the compass. They swarmed over them, a wave of clicking, crystalline
fury. The commander disappeared under a scuttling, thorned mass. I saw a
gauntleted hand, still clutching the compass, raised for a moment before
it was dragged down.</p>
<p>The pathway shattered.</p>
<p>It wasn’t an explosion. It was a dissolution. The grey static blew
apart into meaningless pixels of light and dark. The suction stopped.
The skiff tumbled, end over end, through a kaleidoscope of broken
realities.</p>
<p>I saw a flash of a sun-drenched meadow. A glimpse of a storm-lashed
sea. A corridor of endless, identical doors. A room filled with ticking
clocks. All of it, fractured, overlapping, meaningless.</p>
<p>Then, with a final, gut-wrenching lurch, the skiff was
<em>expelled</em>.</p>
<p>We crashed back into solidity with a sound of shearing metal and
splintering wood. Not in the cavern. Not in any recognizable place.</p>
<p>We were in a narrow, high-ceilinged gorge. The stone was the same
black, humming material, but here it was cracked and fractured. Tangled,
phosphorescent moss hung from the walls like ragged curtains. The air
was still and cold and smelled of ozone and damp.</p>
<p>Above us, where a sky should have been, was a jagged tear of
swirling, chaotic colour—the slowly healing scar of the Gateway’s
rupture. As we watched, it sealed itself, fading into the black rock
until it was just a faint, shimmering seam. The door was closed. Perhaps
for good.</p>
<p>The silence that followed was deafening.</p>
<p>The skiff was a wreck. Its hull was cracked, one runner completely
torn off. It listed badly. Finn crawled out from the cabin, a cut on his
forehead leaking blood into his eye. He looked at his vessel and let out
a sound that was half sob, half laugh.</p>
<p>Leo helped Kaela to her feet. She was shaking, her arms wrapped
around herself. The knife was still in her hand.</p>
<p>I lay on the cold stone, staring up at the sealed scar. The current
was gone. Truly gone. The compass was gone. The Gleaner was gone. The
Gateway was closed. The Oblivion Guard commander was gone, tax collected
by a different agent.</p>
<p>All paths forward were gone.</p>
<p>I had forgotten my name, my past, my purpose. And now, I had
forgotten my way. The clerical error in my soul was complete. I was a
file with no label, in a drawer that no longer existed.</p>
<p>Then Kaela spoke, her voice hollow in the quiet gorge. “We’re
alive.”</p>
<p>It was a statement, not a celebration.</p>
<p>Leo leaned on his axe, breathing heavily. “Where?”</p>
<p>Finn wiped blood from his face, surveying the moss-choked walls.
“Nowhere on any chart I’ve ever seen. The skiff’s dead. The main route…”
He glanced at the sealed scar in the ceiling. “Gone.”</p>
<p>I pushed myself up. My body ached. My mind felt scoured, empty. I
looked at my hands. They were still dirty. They were still my hands.
Presumably.</p>
<p>The tenth thing I forgot was the way home. And in the forgetting, I
understood: there never had been one. There were only turnip fields, and
disappointed potatoes, and doors that led to more doors, and the only
thing you ever truly owned was the dirt under your fingernails.</p>
<p>Kaela came and sat beside me on the stone. She didn’t speak. She just
sat, her shoulder touching mine. A point of warmth in the cold,
forgotten gorge.</p>
<p>After a long time, Finn said, “The moss. It’s not native to this
stone. It’s growing <em>on</em> it. Something brought it here. Or it
drifted from somewhere else.”</p>
<p>He pointed. Further down the gorge, the phosphorescent growth was
thicker, forming a faint, glowing trail that snaked into the
darkness.</p>
<p>A path. Not the main route. A side path. A forgotten path.</p>
<p>Leo hefted his axe onto his shoulder. He looked at the wreck of the
skiff, at the sealed ceiling, at the two of us sitting in the dirt. He
nodded once, toward the glowing moss.</p>
<p>“Forward,” he said.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a direction. It was the only thing left.</p>
<p>I stood up. I had no spade. No key. No memory. Just the dirt, and the
quiet, and the faint, green glow leading away from the closed door.</p>
<p>The eleventh thing I forgot was how to give up. It must have happened
sometime during the fall. A misplacement. A clerical error in the
soul.</p>
<p>We walked toward the light.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-9">Chapter 9</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-9-1"><strong>CHAPTER 9</strong></h2>
<p>The twelfth thing I forgot was the taste of fear. It didn’t vanish.
It just changed, like water turning to silt in the mouth. It became a
texture, a grit you learned to chew. We stood in the corpse-light of the
moss, and the silence was a third presence, listening back.</p>
<p>Leo moved first. Not toward the glowing trail, but back to the
wreckage of the skiff. It lay like a broken insect, its brass ribs
splayed, the faint hum of its heartstone engine now a dead, cold weight
in the air. He didn’t look at it with grief. He looked at it like a
butcher surveys a carcass, seeing not the life lost but the utility
remaining. His axe, still notched from the gateway stone, he planted in
the gravel. He began to dig through the splintered planking with his
hands.</p>
<p>“It’s gone, Leo,” Finn said, his voice flat. He was pressing a wad of
moss to a cut on his temple. The green glow seeped into his skin, making
him look like a man pieced together from wrong parts. “The mainspring’s
cracked. It’s scrap.”</p>
<p>“Not looking for the spring,” Leo grunted. He heaved a section of
decking aside. Something clattered, metallic, into a hollow beneath. He
reached in, his broad shoulders blocking our view. When he straightened,
he was holding a piece of the gateway. Not a fragment. A keystone.</p>
<p>It was about the size of a book, but thicker, denser. In the archway
it had been one of many, a dull, geometric tooth in a stone jaw. Here,
separated, it seemed to swallow the moss-light. It wasn’t black. It was
the <em>idea</em> of black, a hole cut in the world’s fabric. Its edges
were perfectly sharp, but its surface was not smooth. It was carved with
channels so fine they looked like hair-cracks, all converging on a
central, thumb-sized depression.</p>
<p>“It fell,” Leo said, as if that explained everything. He brushed
stone dust from it with a tenderness I’d never seen him use. “When the
door sealed. It fell <em>through</em>.”</p>
<p>Kaela drew in a sharp breath. “That’s not possible. The gate’s
integrity…”</p>
<p>“Was compromised,” Leo finished. He looked at her, then at the
keystone in his hands. “By us. By the axe. It didn’t just close. It
broke. And this piece broke with it.” He ran a thumb over the central
depression. “It’s a permanent key. Not a compass that points. A tool
that <em>makes</em>.”</p>
<p>The weight of it settled on us. Finn stopped tending his cut. I felt
the clerical error in my soul twitch, a phantom pain. We had a compass
that found paths. This was different. This was a chisel that could,
theoretically, carve a door where a door was not meant to be. The power
of it was not thrilling. It was obscene. It was like finding a surgeon’s
scalpel in a turnip field.</p>
<p>Leo tucked it into a leather satchel he salvaged from the wreck, the
kind meant for carrying tools. It didn’t bulge. It simply made the
satchel look heavier, as if it were filled with lead instead of linen.
He slung it over his shoulder, the strap crossing his chest. The weight
of it seemed to straighten his spine, to plant him more firmly in the
gravel of that forgotten gorge.</p>
<p>“Forward,” he said again, but the word had a new colour to it. It was
no longer the only thing left. It was now a choice.</p>
<p>We walked.</p>
<p>The moss trail was not a path so much as a suggestion. It clung to
the western wall of the gorge, a meandering, bioluminescent vein in the
rock. The air was cold and still, smelling of damp stone and something
else—a faint, alkaline tang, like old parchment dissolving in water. Our
footsteps were the only sound, a dry shuffle that echoed back at us from
the narrowing walls.</p>
<p>Kaela walked beside me, her shoulder no longer touching mine but her
presence a constant, warm pressure against the chill. After an hour of
silent progress, she spoke, her voice low, meant only for me and the
moss.</p>
<p>“My grandfather,” she began, then stopped. She was unspooling a
memory, testing its strength. “He was a cartographer of places that
move. He knew that main routes could be… censored. Blockaded. He
believed in backdoors.”</p>
<p>I looked at her. In the green light, her face was all hollows and
sharp edges, a map of its own. “Backdoors to where?”</p>
<p>“To the places the routes are meant to reach. The Sundered Realm.
The… other places. The Oblivion Guard doesn’t just guard the doors. They
own the hallways. My grandfather thought there were cracks in their
ownership. Servant’s passages. Forgotten conduits.” She pulled a small,
battered journal from an inner pocket. It was the one she’d consulted on
the skiff. The leather was stained, the pages swollen with damp. “He
didn’t just chart the main ways. He hunted for the seams.”</p>
<p>Finn, walking ahead with Leo, glanced back. His eyes caught the
journal and he slowed, falling into step with us. “You’ve been holding
out, archivist.”</p>
<p>“I’ve been deciphering,” she corrected, a flicker of her old fire
returning. “His notations are… personal. Metaphorical. He doesn’t write
‘a hidden path behind the waterfall of time.’ He writes ‘the laundry
chute of the gods.’ It takes interpretation.”</p>
<p>She opened the journal to a page marked with a strip of faded velvet.
The script was a frantic, angular scrawl, punctuated by tiny, precise
sketches of geological formations that looked like anatomical drawings.
She pointed to a paragraph.</p>
<p>“<em>The Guard polishes the front steps until they shine, but the
muck and the meaning track through the scullery,</em>” she read aloud.
“<em>Find the kitchen midden. Follow the stain.</em>”</p>
<p>Leo had stopped now. He stood a few yards ahead, a dark silhouette
against the pulsing moss. He wasn’t looking at the journal. He was
looking at the wall. “The stain,” he repeated, his voice a low
rumble.</p>
<p>He wasn’t holding the compass. It was still in its pouch on his belt.
Instead, he lifted a hand and placed his palm flat against the stone,
right beside the thickest run of glowing moss. He closed his eyes. His
breathing slowed.</p>
<p>We watched. The gorge held its breath.</p>
<p>After a long minute, his eyes opened. They held a strange, distant
focus. “It’s not a trail. It’s a leak.” He turned his head, looking
further down the gorge, into the deeper darkness beyond the moss’s
reach. “The pressure is different there. Softer. There’s a… a give.”</p>
<p>He took his hand from the wall, looked at his palm as if expecting to
see an imprint, then nodded to himself. He started walking again, not
along the mossy vein, but angling away from it, toward a section of the
gorge wall that was bare, shadowed stone.</p>
<p>“Leo,” Finn said, caution in his tone. “The light…”</p>
<p>“The light is the spill,” Leo said, not turning. “I’m looking for the
crack in the jug.”</p>
<p>He walked with a new certainty. It wasn’t the bold, axe-led
confidence of before. This was quieter, more internal. It was the
confidence of a man who has heard a faint, familiar tune through a thick
wall and is now feeling for the latch. He no longer consulted the
compass. He paused occasionally, hand outstretched, fingers slightly
curled, as if testing the air for a current. The keystone in his satchel
seemed to pull him, a silent, gravitational weight.</p>
<p>We followed, leaving the safe, glowing trail behind. The darkness
deepened, broken only by the faint, reflected glow from the moss now
twenty paces to our left. The alkaline smell grew stronger.</p>
<p>Then Leo stopped. Before him was a sheer wall of the same dark,
water-smoothed stone as the rest of the gorge. It looked utterly
featureless. He stood before it, head cocked.</p>
<p>“Here,” he said.</p>
<p>“Here is a wall,” Finn observed, his arms crossed.</p>
<p>Leo ignored him. He reached out, not to push, but to trace the stone
with his fingertips. He moved them in a slow, deliberate pattern, from
the height of his shoulder down to his waist, then back up in a narrower
arc. He was retracing a shape only he could sense. A shape, I realized,
like the keystone in his bag.</p>
<p>His fingers stopped. He pressed.</p>
<p>With a sound like a long-held sigh, a section of the stone—a perfect,
keystone-shaped slab—sank inwards an inch and slid sideways, revealing
not a doorway, but a crack. A narrow, vertical fissure, just wider than
a man’s shoulders. From it breathed out air that was several degrees
warmer, carrying the smell of wet soil, rotting leaves, and that same
alkaline tang, now overwhelming.</p>
<p>A backdoor.</p>
<p>Leo turned to us. In the gloom, his smile was a quick, hard flash.
“The scullery,” he said.</p>
<p>He went first, turning sideways to shuffle into the fissure. The
stone swallowed him. Kaela went next, then me. Finn brought up the rear,
his hand on the grip of his pistol. The stone was cold and close,
pressing on my chest and back. I counted ten shuffling steps in utter
blackness, the only sound our ragged breath and the scrape of cloth on
rock.</p>
<p>Then the fissure opened.</p>
<p>We spilled out not into another gorge, but onto a ledge overlooking a
cavern so vast its ceiling was lost in a haze of its own making. It was
not dark. A sickly, phosphorescent fungus clung to every surface—walls,
towering stalagmites, a forest of petrified trees that hung from the
ceiling like stone roots. The light was a pale, yellowish green, the
colour of a week-old bruise. It illuminated a landscape of surreal,
dripping silence.</p>
<p>Below our ledge, the ground was a chaotic maze of what looked like
ruins, but ruins of no architecture I could name. They were low,
serpentine walls made of the same slick, organic-looking stone, winding
around deep, still pools of black water. The air was thick, humid, and
it tasted of metal and decay.</p>
<p>We stood in a row on the ledge, taking it in. The sheer, forgotten
scale of it pressed the fear-silt down our throats.</p>
<p>“Nowhere on any chart,” Finn whispered, his cynicism stripped away by
awe.</p>
<p>“It’s on one,” Kaela said, her knuckles white on her grandfather’s
journal. She pointed down into the maze. One of the winding walls,
slightly taller than the rest, traced a path that led toward the far end
of the cavern, where the fungal glow throbbed more intensely. “His. He
called it the ‘Midnight Kitchen.’ This is the back way. The delivery
entrance for things that weren’t meant to be served on the front
porch.”</p>
<p>Leo was silent. He had his hand out again, his eyes closed. He was
feeling the pathways of this place, the pressures and the gives. The
keystone on his shoulder was his anchor, his true north in a world with
no sky. When he opened his eyes, they held a grim understanding. “The
Guard doesn’t come here. Not because they can’t. Because they think it’s
a dead end. A septic tank for forgotten realms.” He looked at Kaela.
“Your grandfather was a genius. Or a madman.”</p>
<p>“The difference is academic,” she said.</p>
<p>We descended from the ledge via a natural staircase of crumbling
rock. The silence of the cavern was absolute. There was no drip of
water, no scuttle of life. Our footsteps were muffled by a thick layer
of soft, grey dust that coated everything. It was the dust of centuries,
of millennia, undisturbed.</p>
<p>As we picked our way into the maze of low walls, the dynamic between
us began to solidify, like cooling wax. The loss of the skiff, the
sealing of the door, the plummet into this forgotten belly of the
world—it had burned away the last residues of accident, of mere
companionship. We were not four people who had stumbled together. We
were a unit forged in the closing of a door.</p>
<p>Finn, usually ranging ahead as scout, now stayed within clear sight,
his glances back to ensure we were keeping up more frequent, more
deliberate. His wit was still there, but it was quieter, aimed now at
easing tension, not creating it. “Charming décor,” he muttered, flicking
a piece of the glowing fungus off a wall. “Really brings out the green
in your eyes, Emeric.”</p>
<p>Kaela walked with the journal open in one hand, her other often
resting lightly on my arm to guide me around a particularly deep pool or
a patch of unnervingly soft ground. Her explanations were no longer
lectures, but shared thinking. “See how this wall curves? He notes that.
Says ‘the soup ladle always points to the larder.’ The larder
being…”</p>
<p>“The way out,” I finished. The words felt less strange in my mouth
now. They were just tools, like the spade I no longer had.</p>
<p>And Leo. Leo had become our quiet centre. He didn’t lead from the
front with shouted orders. He moved with a ponderous, inevitable grace,
a boulder finding its path down a hillside. He would pause, feel the
air, consult something in the weight of the satchel on his chest, and
point. There was no debate. We followed. The axe on his back was no
longer just a weapon; it was a promise. A promise that if a door needed
to be broken, he would break it. If a path needed to be cut, he would
cut it.</p>
<p>We were bound by the shared dirt under our fingernails, by the same
clerical error in our souls. Our purpose was no longer a vague,
scholarly quest to see a Sundered Realm. It was a sharp, clear point: to
stop the Oblivion Guard from doing whatever they were doing that
required doors to be sealed and paths to be forgotten. To stop them from
making more of this—more silent, fungal graves for worlds.</p>
<p>We reached the centre of the maze as the fungal light in the cavern
began to dim in a slow, circadian rhythm, mimicking a dying day. Here,
the serpentine walls opened into a circular clearing. In its centre was
not a pool, but a structure. A plinth of that same organic stone, and on
it, a statue.</p>
<p>It was humanoid, but elongated, its features smoothed by time and
moisture into vague, sorrowful impressions. It was kneeling, its head
bowed, its hands held out before it, palms up and empty. Offering
nothing. Begging for nothing. Just a monument to surrender.</p>
<p>We approached it slowly. The dust here was untouched.</p>
<p>“A sentinel?” Finn wondered aloud, his hand near his pistol.</p>
<p>“A tombstone,” Kaela said, her voice hushed. She circled the plinth.
“For the path itself. My grandfather has a symbol for it.” She showed us
the journal. In the margin was a tiny sketch of the same kneeling
figure. Beside it, he had written: <em>‘Here lies the servant’s
ambition. It forgot its name, too.’</em></p>
<p>I looked at the statue’s empty hands. I looked at my own. The dirt
was still there, ground into the creases of my palms, under my nails. A
name was a label on a file. A purpose was a direction on a chart. These
could be misplaced. But the dirt was proof of work done, of ground
touched, of a reality engaged. It was the one thing the clerical error
could not erase.</p>
<p>Leo stood before the statue, his head level with its bowed stone
face. He didn’t speak to it. He studied it, as if reading a map in its
sorrow. Then he turned, not back the way we came, but to a section of
the wall behind the plinth. This wall was different. It was straighter,
and set into it were a series of dark, vertical slots, like empty
shelves or giant keyholes.</p>
<p>He walked to it, unslung his satchel, and drew out the keystone. He
held it up, comparing its shape to the slots. None matched exactly. He
moved down the line, slowly, methodically.</p>
<p>“What is this place?” I asked, the sound of my own voice startling in
the hushed clearing.</p>
<p>“A junction,” Kaela said, tracing the wall with her eyes. “A
forgotten switchyard. These slots… they’re for different keystones.
Different doors. This is where you’d choose your destination, if you had
the right key and the right authority.” She looked at the kneeling
statue. “And the right will.”</p>
<p>Leo stopped at the seventh slot. He held the keystone up beside it.
The proportions were wrong. Our keystone was smaller, less ornate. It
was a servant’s key, not a master’s.</p>
<p>He lowered it, a frown deepening on his face. Then his eyes cleared.
He wasn’t looking at the slot itself, but at the space around it, at the
texture of the stone. He raised his hand and placed it flat against the
wall to the right of the slot, just as he had in the gorge.</p>
<p>He pushed.</p>
<p>A section of the wall, indistinguishable from the rest, pivoted
inward with a groan of stone on stone. Not a door. A niche. And within
the niche, on a simple stone pedestal, lay a single object.</p>
<p>It was another keystone.</p>
<p>But where ours was a hole cut in the world, this one was… a wound. It
was roughly the same size, but its material was opaque, a mottled,
bloody crimson shot through with black veins. Its surface was not carved
with fine channels. It was scarred, gouged, as if it had been clawed at
by something desperate. At its centre was not a depression, but a
raised, twisted lump of stone that resembled a clenched fist.</p>
<p>The sight of it hit us like a physical blow. The air grew colder. The
faint, ever-present hum of the fungal light seemed to stutter.</p>
<p>“God’s teeth,” Finn breathed, the old oath hanging in the air like a
curse.</p>
<p>Leo did not reach for it. He stared, his face a mask of grim
recognition. “The backdoor isn’t just a path,” he said, his voice barely
a rumble. “It’s a trap. A test.”</p>
<p>Kaela stepped forward, the journal trembling in her hands. She
flipped pages frantically. “He… he never described this. He only said
the Midnight Kitchen had one exit. The ‘Chef’s Exit.’ He said you had to
pay the bill.”</p>
<p>“With what?” Finn asked, his eyes locked on the scarred red
stone.</p>
<p>Leo answered, his gaze never leaving the niche. “With the right key.
Ours opens the way. That one…” He nodded at the crimson keystone. “That
one is the bill. It’s not for navigation. It’s a token. A proof of
passage. You take it with you. And it marks you.”</p>
<p>He understood now. The kneeling statue. The empty hands. It wasn’t
surrendering. It was waiting. Waiting for someone to come back from the
Chef’s Exit and return the token. To close the account. No one ever
had.</p>
<p>The weight of the cavern, of the centuries of dust, pressed down. We
had our path. We had our purpose, solid and sharp. We had a key that
could make doors.</p>
<p>And now, we had a choice that was no choice at all.</p>
<p>Leo looked at each of us—at Finn’s wary scowl, at Kaela’s scholarly
dread, at my own empty hands. He saw the unit we had become. He saw the
shared dirt.</p>
<p>Without a word, he reached into the niche and took the scarred red
keystone.</p>
<p>It did not burn him. It did not scream. It simply sat in his large
palm, pulsing with a slow, ugly light that seemed to drain the colour
from the air around it. The fungal glow dimmed further. The silence
became a listening, hungry thing.</p>
<p>Leo placed it carefully into his satchel, alongside the black one.
The leather did not just look heavier. It looked stained, as if already
bleeding.</p>
<p>“Forward,” he said for the third time. His voice was iron, final.</p>
<p>He turned from the niche, from the kneeling statue, and led us toward
the far end of the clearing, where the wall opened into a low, dark
archway—the Chef’s Exit. We followed, as we had followed him from the
turnip field, from the sealed gate, from the light into the dark.</p>
<p>The thirteenth thing I forgot was the illusion of clean hands. You
think you can wash the dirt away. You can’t. It migrates. It becomes the
grit in your soul, the stain on your purpose. We walked toward the arch,
marked now, carrying our proof of passage. The black key to make a way.
The red key to prove we’d been there.</p>
<p>The bond between us was absolute. It was a chain, and a shield, and
the only compass that mattered anymore. We were united by loss, by
purpose, and now, by a shared, scarlet debt.</p>
<p>We stepped into the archway. The fungal light did not follow. The
darkness ahead was total.</p>
<p>And from within that darkness, as if it had been waiting for the
precise moment our second foot left the dust of the clearing, a sound
echoed back to us. Not a sigh, not a groan.</p>
<p>A dry, rattling, deliberate <em>click</em>.</p>
<p>Like the sound of a stone lock, turning.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-10">Chapter 10</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-10-1"><strong>CHAPTER 10</strong></h2>
<p>The first thing I remembered was the taste of iron. It was not a
memory of a thing, but a memory of a taste, and it flooded my mouth as
we stepped into the dark. It was the taste of the red keystone’s pulse,
the taste of the click that had followed us. It was the taste of a debt
coming due.</p>
<p>Leo did not pause. He moved into the blackness as if it were a
familiar room, his shape a solid blot against nothing. Kaela followed,
her breathing a tight, controlled rhythm beside me. Finn was a whisper
of leather and restless energy at the rear. We were a chain of four
links, and the darkness was a weight on every one.</p>
<p>After twenty paces, the black softened to a deep, bruised grey.
Light, of a kind, seeped in. It was not the fungal glow of the cavern,
nor any sun I could name. It was the colour of a week-old bruise, a
sickly yellow-purple that stained the air itself. It revealed we were in
a tunnel of rough, wet stone, but the walls seemed to breathe,
contracting and expanding with a slow, viscous sigh.</p>
<p>“The borderlands,” Kaela murmured, her voice swallowed by the damp
rock. “The interstitial tissue between realms. It’s… volatile.”</p>
<p>“Volatile’s a word for a chemical that might pop,” Finn said from
behind. “This place feels like it’s thinking about popping. There’s a
difference.”</p>
<p>Leo stopped. He shrugged the satchel from his shoulder, the movement
careful, ritualistic. He opened the flap. The ugly, scarlet light from
within leaked out, painting his jaw and throat in pulsing washes. It
made the scar on his cheek look fresh. He did not remove the red
keystone. Instead, he laid his palm flat upon it, inside the bag.</p>
<p>He closed his eyes.</p>
<p>A shudder went through him, a full-body flinch as if he’d touched a
live nerve buried in the world. His breath hissed between his teeth. The
bruise-light in the tunnel flickered, and for a second I saw something
else—a jagged landscape of impossible angles, a sky ripped like canvas,
a wind that blew in visible, razor-sharp ribbons. It was there and gone,
a retinal burn.</p>
<p>“It knows the way,” Leo said, his voice strained. He opened his eyes.
They held the red pulse deep within, like embers in a pit. “It remembers
the paths its makers walked. But the memory is… damaged. Angry. Follow
my steps exactly. The ground here doesn’t forgive a misstep.”</p>
<p>He began to walk, not faster, but with a new, terrible precision. We
followed, placing our boots in the prints his left, our world narrowed
to the span of his heels. The tunnel opened out.</p>
<p>We stood on a shore.</p>
<p>There was no sea. Instead, a plain of shattered, glass-like stone
stretched to a horizon lost in a churning haze. Above, the sky was not
sky. It was a storm of static, of fragmented colour and deafening
silence. Lightning did not flash; it <em>unfolded</em>, in slow,
crystalline branches that left after-images of broken geometry. The air
smelled of ozone and burnt hair.</p>
<p>“God’s teeth,” I breathed. The phrase felt borrowed, but it fit.</p>
<p>“Save your prayers,” Leo said, not turning. “They’re just more static
here. This way.”</p>
<p>The path he chose was not a path. It was a suggestion of slightly
less insanity—a ridge of black obsidian that wound between pools of
shimmering, silver nothing. The keystone’s pull led him left, then
right, in a zigzag that made no sense. We stepped over fissures that
exhaled air so cold it burned, and skirted patches of ground that sang
in a high, maddening whine.</p>
<p>I forgot my feet were tired. I forgot the ache in my shoulders from
the climb. Those were clean, simple aches. Here, the weariness was
different. It was the fatigue of a mind trying to parse a world that
refused to hold its shape. A boulder to our left was a boulder. Then, in
the periphery, it was a crouching thing with too many joints. You’d look
directly at it, and it was a boulder again, sweating black tears.</p>
<p>The second thing I remembered was a story. Not the whole thing, just
a fragment, like a shard of pottery dug up in a field. A story about a
man who traded his shadow for a bag of gold. He thought it a fine
bargain, until he realized a man without a shadow is a man the light
doesn’t believe in. I didn’t know why I remembered it. Then I looked
down.</p>
<p>My shadow was gone. Not stretched behind me or pooled at my feet.
Simply absent. The bruise-light fell on me, on all of us, and cast
nothing.</p>
<p>“Don’t look at it,” Kaela said softly, ahead of me. She wasn’t
looking at her own feet either. “Don’t think about it. This place… it
feeds on absence. On lack.”</p>
<p>We walked for what felt like hours in that timeless, shattered place.
The only constant was the satchel at Leo’s side, bleeding its slow red
pulse into the leather, and the chain of us that followed. The bond was
the only real thing. Finn’s muttered curses, the solid line of Kaela’s
back, the iron certainty of Leo’s lead. It was a compass. It was a
tether.</p>
<p>It was what they heard.</p>
<p>The howl, when it came, was not sound. It was the <em>idea</em> of
sound given form—a cold, thin wire drawn straight through the centre of
your skull. It was loss given a voice. It echoed across the glass plain,
seeming to come from everywhere and from the hollow place behind your
ribs.</p>
<p>Leo froze. “Down.”</p>
<p>We dropped behind the ridge of obsidian. The static storm above
seemed to hush, to listen.</p>
<p>Another howl answered the first, closer. Then a third, a fourth, a
chorus of hollow, hungry things tuning their instruments.</p>
<p>“The Oblivion Guard doesn’t send men into the borderlands,” Kaela
whispered, her scholarly dread a flat, cold fact. “They send hounds.
Spectral trackers. They don’t follow scent. They follow… discontinuity.
The tear you leave in the world by passing through it.”</p>
<p>“The keystone,” I said.</p>
<p>“The keystone,” Leo confirmed, his hand protective over the satchel.
“And the debt. They’re coming for their proof of passage.”</p>
<p>He peered over the ridge. His face, already grim, set into something
absolute. “Run. Now. Not in my steps. Just run. For the far edge of the
plain. There’s a canyon there. Go.”</p>
<p>We ran.</p>
<p>The ground, which had been treacherously solid, now seemed to revolt.
The glassy stone splintered underfoot, becoming a shifting scree. The
silver pools bubbled and reached with vaporous tendrils. The howls
crystallized into a sustained, piercing keen that drilled into the
spine.</p>
<p>I risked a glance back.</p>
<p>They were not hounds. They were the ghosts of hounds, sketched in
negative against the bruised light—outlines of loping, elongated forms,
all silent snarl and gathered momentum. Where their paws touched the
ground, the colour drained, leaving behind patches of absolute,
void-like black. They were erasers, deleting the world as they came.</p>
<p>“Faster!” Finn yelled, not from fear, but from a kind of furious
glee. He was in his element: motion, chaos, the simple equation of
pursuit.</p>
<p>We ran until our lungs were rags, until the taste of iron was
replaced by the copper-penny tang of blood. The edge of the plain rushed
toward us—a jagged line where the world simply stopped. The canyon. As
we neared, I saw it was not empty. A narrow, shuddering bridge of
petrified light, like frozen lightning, spanned the abyss. It was the
only way.</p>
<p>Leo reached it first, testing it with a boot. It held. “Kaela,
Emeric, go! Finn, with me!”</p>
<p>Kaela scrambled onto the bridge. It was solid yet insubstantial,
humming underfoot. I followed. The world dropped away beneath us into a
deep of swirling, chaotic fog. The howls were at the canyon’s edge
now.</p>
<p>I turned to see Leo and Finn standing shoulder-to-shoulder, facing
the pack of void-hounds. Leo had drawn his heavy blade. Finn held his
two short, wicked knives. They looked like men trying to hold back a
tide with their hands.</p>
<p>“Leo!” I shouted.</p>
<p>“Go!” he roared, not turning.</p>
<p>But Finn turned. He looked past Leo, past the hounds, to the far side
of the canyon where Kaela and I stood. He looked at me, and for a
moment, the wary scowl was gone. In its place was a stark, simple
clarity. He gave a sharp, almost imperceptible nod.</p>
<p>Then he moved.</p>
<p>He didn’t attack the hounds. He darted to the side, to where a
strange, boat-like construct of woven bone and taut membrane was
tethered—a skiff, left by some previous, foolhardy traveller. He slashed
the tether with a knife.</p>
<p>“Finn, what are you doing?” Leo barked, deflecting a lunge from a
hound with a shower of sparks from his blade.</p>
<p>“Buying a better price!” Finn yelled back. He shoved the skiff to the
very lip of the chasm, directly in the path of the bridge. “Get across!
Now!”</p>
<p>Understanding hit Leo like a physical blow. “No.”</p>
<p>“Yes!” Finn planted his feet behind the skiff. He looked at Leo, and
his grin was a wild, white slash in the gloom. “Tell ‘em Finn of the
Twisted Root died of something expensive!”</p>
<p>He put his shoulder to the skiff and heaved.</p>
<p>The bone craft tipped over the edge. It didn’t fall. It caught,
jamming itself sideways into the mouth of the chasm, a brittle, chaotic
wedge between the cliff face and the near end of the light-bridge.</p>
<p>The spectral hounds, flowing like liquid shadow, hit the obstruction.
They could not pass over it; the skiff was a physical thing, and they
were creatures of erasure. They pooled against it, scrabbling, their
silent fury a pressure in the air. The bridge shuddered violently, but
held.</p>
<p>The way was blocked. The price was paid.</p>
<p>Leo stood for one more second, a statue of fury and grief. Then he
turned and ran onto the bridge, his boots pounding the humming light. He
didn’t look back.</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>Finn stood on the other side of the jammed skiff, surrounded by the
swirling, hungry voids of the hounds. He wasn’t looking at them. He was
watching us go. He raised a hand, not a wave, but a dismissal. A final,
cocky flick of the fingers.</p>
<p>Then the fog of the chasm rolled up, and he was gone.</p>
<p>The third thing I remembered was his voice in the dark, days ago,
saying, <em>“Everyone’s got a price. The trick is to make sure you’re
the one spending.”</em></p>
<p>The bridge ended on a ledge of rough, black rock. Leo collapsed to
his knees, not from exhaustion, but from a weight that had nothing to do
with the satchel. His hands were fists on his thighs. The sound he made
was not a sob. It was the sound of a chain snapping deep inside a
man.</p>
<p>Kaela stood beside him, her face pale, her fingers pressed to her
lips. Her scholarly dread had been spent. What was left was a
hollowed-out recognition. This was the cost of the ledger. This was the
entry, written in blood and bone.</p>
<p>I stood apart, my empty hands hanging. The grit in my soul, the stain
on our purpose, was now a name. Finn. The bond was absolute. It was a
chain, and a shield. And now, one of its links was gone, left in the
jaws of oblivion. The compass needle spun.</p>
<p>After a long minute, Leo pushed himself to his feet. He did not speak
of Finn. He did not curse or mourn. He looked at the cliff face before
us. It was sheer, seamless black stone, rising into the roiling, static
sky. A dead end.</p>
<p>“This is it,” he said, his voice scraped raw. “The final threshold.
The door to the Sundered Realm.”</p>
<p>“There is no door,” Kaela said, her voice barely audible.</p>
<p>“There is.” Leo opened the satchel. This time, he drew out both
keystones. The black one, cold and absorbing light. The red one, pulsing
its sickly rhythm. He held one in each hand, arms slightly outstretched,
like a scale weighing two different kinds of damnation.</p>
<p>The cliff face began to <em>waver</em>.</p>
<p>It wasn’t an illusion melting. It was a forgetting. The solid,
immutable rock began to lose its conviction. Its edges blurred. Its
reality softened, like a memory too old to hold its shape. Behind it,
bleeding through, was something else: a deeper dark, a different quality
of silence, and a smell like old parchment and cold, deep earth.</p>
<p>“The Sundered Realm doesn’t have gates,” Leo said, staring at the
dissolving stone. “It has… permissions. You don’t find the entrance. You
convince the world you’ve forgotten it was ever closed.”</p>
<p>He stepped forward, into the wavering cliff face. It did not part for
him. He simply ceased to be <em>here</em> and began to be
<em>there</em>, his form dissolving into the distortion.</p>
<p>Kaela followed, a woman walking into a mirage.</p>
<p>I was last. I looked back, across the lightning-bridge, over the
chasm, toward the shattered plain where our ally had fallen. I saw
nothing but the storm and the bruise-light. The memory was already
feeling thin, uncertain. Was his name Finn? Did he have a scowl? The
borderlands were eating it, feeding on the absence.</p>
<p>That was the shattering.</p>
<p>The bond was not absolute. Memory was not a shield. It was the first
thing this place took from you, and it kept taking, layer by layer,
until you were nothing but a series of reactions, a set of tracks in the
dust. We were united by loss, by purpose, by a scarlet debt. But what
were we, if we forgot the loss? If the purpose blurred? If the debt was
to a ghost whose name was slipping away?</p>
<p>The fourth thing I remembered, stepping into the cliff face that was
not a cliff face, was my own name.</p>
<p><em>Emeric.</em></p>
<p>It had the weight of a worn shoe. It had the taste of iron. It was a
clerical error in the soul, a misplacement. It was all I had left to
carry.</p>
<p>The distortion swallowed me. The static-howl of the borderlands cut
off, replaced by a silence so complete it was a noise in itself. The air
was still and cold and old.</p>
<p>We stood in a long, straight corridor of smooth, grey stone. It was
featureless, endless, lit by no source. It stretched ahead into
infinity, and behind into infinity. There were no doors, no windows, no
marks on the walls or floor. Just a perfect, sterile, endless line.</p>
<p>Leo looked down at the keystones in his hands. The red one’s pulse
had slowed, becoming a dull, sullen throb. The black one was inert. He
placed them back in the satchel, the movement final.</p>
<p>“We’re in,” he said.</p>
<p>But his voice held no triumph. It held the hollow echo of the
corridor. We had our path. We had our purpose. We had paid its
price.</p>
<p>And now, in this place that felt less like a realm and more like the
inside of a forgotten thought, we had nothing but the long walk, and the
things we were already beginning to forget.</p>
<p>Leo took the first step. Then another. The corridor accepted them
without echo.</p>
<p>We followed.</p>
<p>And from the grey nothingness ahead, a figure resolved. It was not
walking toward us. It was simply <em>there</em>, as if it had been
waiting, painted onto the emptiness. It was a man in a neat, grey coat,
his hands clasped behind his back. His face was pleasant, blank, and
utterly unfamiliar.</p>
<p>He smiled, a polite, empty curve of the lips.</p>
<p>“Emeric,” he said, and his voice was the sound of a page turning.
“There you are. We’ve been auditing the accounts. There appears to be a
discrepancy.”</p>
<p>He held out a hand. Not in threat. In expectation.</p>
<p>“We’ll need your name.”</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-11">Chapter 11</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-11-1"><strong>CHAPTER 11</strong></h2>
<p>The corridor did not end. It simply changed its mind. The grey walls,
so perfect in their indifference, began to show a hairline crack. Then
another. A spiderweb of imperfection, a flaw in the sterile thought. The
cracks bled light—a soft, gold-green luminescence that smelled of damp
earth and rotting blossoms. The smooth floor underfoot crumbled into
flagstones, moss-cushioned and uneven. The ceiling peeled back, not into
sky, but into a vault of twisted, petrified branches, from which hung
bioluminescent fungi like forgotten lanterns.</p>
<p>We stepped out of the corridor’s throat and into the lung of a dying
world.</p>
<p>It was a cathedral of decay. A forest of colossal, crystalline trees,
their trunks not wood but facets of smoky quartz, rose around us. Their
canopies were shattered lace against a firmament that had no sun, no
stars, only a perpetual, bruised twilight. Between the trunks, meadows
of silver grass sighed, and flowers with glass petals chimed softly in a
breath of wind that shouldn’t have existed. It was beautiful. It was the
beauty of a perfectly preserved corpse in a sealed tomb.</p>
<p>“The Sundered Realm,” Leo whispered. His voice didn’t carry. It was
swallowed by the immense, sleeping silence. “It’s… holding.”</p>
<p>But it was a strained hold. The beauty was fissured. Great chunks of
the crystalline trees had sheared away, lying in glittering, inert
shards. Patches of the silver meadow were bleached bone-white and
crumbling to dust. The air itself had pockets of wrongness—spots where
the light bent sickly, or the scent of rot grew overpowering, or the
silence became a physical pressure on the eardrums. It was a world in
stasis, yes, but a stasis of slow, elegant collapse.</p>
<p>Anais reached out, her fingers hovering over the glass petal of a
flower. “It remembers being whole,” she said, her voice hushed. “The
memory is so strong it keeps the shape. But the substance is
forgetting.”</p>
<p>I knew that feeling. The clerical error in the soul. A name
mis-filed. I touched my own chest, a pointless gesture. <em>Emeric.</em>
It was still there, for now. A worn shoe. An iron taste.</p>
<p>We moved deeper, following a path that was not a path, just a
less-resistant pressing of the silver grass. Leo consulted the compass.
The needle, which had spun wildly in the borderlands, now trembled,
pointing a firm, unwavering course ahead. The red keystone in his
satchel gave a single, dull thump, like a tired heart.</p>
<p>We found him in a clearing where the petrified branches formed a cage
of jagged lace overhead.</p>
<p>A sphere of solidified amber light, about ten feet across, hung a
hand’s breadth above the ground. Inside, suspended in the honey-coloured
glow, was an old man. He floated, curled slightly, as if asleep. His
hair was a white cloud around a face leathered by more than years—by
winds from places that no longer had names. He wore the remnants of a
Wayfinder’s coat, patched and faded. One hand was clutched to his
chest.</p>
<p>Leo stopped. All the breath left him in a silent rush. He didn’t
speak. He just stared. The hollow echo he’d carried since the
borderlands filled with something raw and quiet.</p>
<p>“Grandfather,” he finally said. The word was a key that didn’t fit
the lock.</p>
<p>There was no response. The sphere hummed, a low, sustaining note. A
stasis field. A pause button pressed on a life. Around its base, the
silver grass was dead, and the ground was etched with intricate,
spiralling sigils that pulsed with a faint, grey light. Oblivion Guard
work. Preservation as imprisonment.</p>
<p>“We can break it,” Anais said, stepping forward, her fingers already
moving as if plucking at threads. “The binding is complex, but it’s a
weave. I can unravel it.”</p>
<p>“Don’t.”</p>
<p>The voice came from behind the crystalline trees. It was calm,
measured, without threat. The man in the neat grey coat stepped into the
clearing. He was not alone. Six others emerged from the shimmering air,
as if they’d been part of the scenery—men and women in the same
unadorned grey, faces pleasant and blank as clean slates. The Oblivion
Guard. Their commander stood slightly ahead, his hands still clasped
behind his back.</p>
<p>“Breaking the field would be… unwise,” he said. His eyes, the colour
of old lead, settled on Leo. “He is the anchor. The point of stability
in this sector of the decay. Remove him, and this pocket of remembered
beauty dissolves into the screaming static in approximately forty-three
seconds. We have calculated it.”</p>
<p>Leo’s hand was inside his satchel, gripping the keystone. “You’re
holding him hostage.”</p>
<p>“We are preserving evidence,” the commander corrected. His smile was
the same polite, empty curve. “And preventing a greater error. My name
is Alaric. We are auditors. And your account, Wayfinder, is deeply in
the red.”</p>
<p>He took a step, not toward Leo, but toward the stasis field. He gazed
at the floating figure with something like clinical appreciation. “He
came here, to this crumbling edge of things, chasing a theory. That the
realms could be <em>re-knit</em>. Not just patched with will and memory,
but truly healed. A noble fantasy.” Alaric turned back to us. “It is a
fantasy that would doom us all.”</p>
<p>Anais’s threads were visible now, a faint silver net gathered in her
hands. “You steal memories. You burn histories. You call that
salvation?”</p>
<p>“We call it pruning,” Alaric said. “A garden overgrown will choke
itself. A mind too full cannot think. The Prophecy of the Final Recall
is not a myth. It is a thermodynamic certainty. The weight of
accumulated memory—of every lost thing, every forgotten breath, every
discarded realm—will reach a critical mass. It will collapse in upon
itself. And it will <em>un-write</em> everything adjacent to it. Not
destroy. Erase. As if it never was. Your name, your turnip field, your
worn shoes—all will become a clerical error for which there is no
ledger.”</p>
<p>He spoke with the calm certainty of a man reciting the fall of rain.
“Our purpose is not malice. It is mercy. A controlled burn. We sever the
dying limbs—the Sundered Realms, the bloated, rotten memories—to save
the tree. We are the surgeons of reality. And you…” He looked at Leo,
then at me. “You are a infection. A sentimentalist dragging ghosts into
the present. And he,” a nod to the stasis field, “is the original
vector.”</p>
<p>The air grew colder. The commander’s blankness was more terrifying
than any fury. He believed it. Every word. He was the man with the
ledger, and in his columns, we were a discrepancy to be corrected.</p>
<p>Leo’s face was stone. “So you lock him away. To stop him healing this
place.”</p>
<p>“To stop him <em>accelerating the collapse</em>,” Alaric said. “His
‘healing’ would be a bridge. A conduit. The Final Recall would rush
across it, into the heart of the living realms. Our models are clear.
The only path to survival is isolation. Closure. A clean, quiet end for
places like this, while the core remains protected. We are not the
villains of this story. We are the custodians of the last, best memory.
The one that says: <em>we were here</em>.”</p>
<p>He held out his hand again, the gesture from the corridor. Not to
Leo. To me.</p>
<p>“The discrepancy. Your name, Emeric. It is… loose. Unattached. It has
a weight it should not carry. It is a risk. A frayed thread. Give it to
me. Let it be filed away. It will be painless. You won’t even miss
it.”</p>
<p>I felt it then—the pull. Not a physical force, but a logical one. The
tidy, awful sense of it. A name in the wrong box. A misplacement. Why
not let the clerk correct it? The silence would be clean. The emptiness
would be pure.</p>
<p>I took a step back. My mouth was dry. “It’s all I have left to
carry,” I said, echoing my own thought from the cliff face. The words
were a weak defense.</p>
<p>“Precisely,” Alaric said softly. “A burden. Let us relieve you.”</p>
<p>Leo moved then. He stepped between Alaric and me, his back straight.
“You’re wrong,” he said. His voice didn’t boom. It was low, frayed, but
it cut the cold air. “You’ve read your prophecy, but you’ve forgotten
how to read the world. You see a overload, a collapse. You see a debt to
be cleared.”</p>
<p>He turned to face his grandfather in the amber. “He saw something
else. He saw a pattern. Not a weight, but a <em>balance</em>.” Leo
pulled the keystone from his satchel. The red light pulsed once, weakly,
in time with the sphere’s hum. He held up the compass. The needle
pointed straight at the stasis field, then quivered, wanting to
spin.</p>
<p>“You think closure is the answer. A wall. But a wall just puts
pressure on the fault line. The Recall isn’t a punishment for too much
memory. It’s a symptom of <em>imbalance</em>. One realm bleeds into
another because the channels are broken. The pressure isn’t from the
memory itself. It’s from the memory trying to return home and finding no
door.”</p>
<p>Alaric’s polite smile didn’t waver. “A poetic theory. It lacks
arithmetic.”</p>
<p>“Then let’s calculate,” Leo said. He wasn’t looking at the commander
anymore. He was looking at a spot twenty paces to the left of the
clearing, where the air shimmered with a sick, oily distortion. A local
rift. A tiny, weeping crack in the skin of this dying world. Through it,
I could hear the faint, distant scream of the borderlands static.</p>
<p>Leo walked toward it. The Oblivion Guard tensed but Alaric raised a
hand, watching with academic curiosity.</p>
<p>“What are you doing, Wayfinder? You cannot seal a rift without a
sacrifice. A memory of equal weight. That is the arithmetic.”</p>
<p>“I’m not going to seal it,” Leo said.</p>
<p>He stopped at the edge of the distortion. The silver grass was
bleached dead here, the crystal trees twisted into agonized shapes. He
held the red keystone in one hand, the compass in the other. He closed
his eyes.</p>
<p>He did not offer a memory. He did not try to wall anything up.</p>
<p>He began to <em>sing</em>.</p>
<p>It was not a song with words. It was a low, resonant hum, a vibration
that came from deep in his chest. It was the sound of a door opening. A
path being remembered. The keystone flared, not with a flash, but with a
slow, warm glow that spread like liquid light down his arm. The compass
needle began to spin, not wildly, but in a slow, widening gyre.</p>
<p>He was using the keystone not as a key, nor as a plug. He was using
it as a tuning fork.</p>
<p>The hum matched the hum of the stasis field. Then it shifted,
harmonizing with the deeper, broken frequency of the rift. The oily
distortion shuddered. The static scream softened, warped, became a
chorus of a thousand faint, echoing whispers—the memories trapped in the
bleed. Leo’s song wove between them. He wasn’t silencing them. He was
giving them a direction. A way back.</p>
<p>The light from the keystone reached out, a tendril of red-gold, and
touched the rift.</p>
<p>The rift did not close.</p>
<p>It <em>changed</em>.</p>
<p>The oily shimmer solidified into a momentary archway. A ghost of a
door. Through it, for a single, breathtaking second, I didn’t see
static. I saw a flash of green—a vivid, living, sun-drenched leaf. The
scent of turned earth, real earth, flooded the clearing. The sound of a
bird, one clear note.</p>
<p>Then the archway faded. The rift remained, but it was quiet now. A
still, silver scar in the air. The pressure was gone. The bleeding had
stopped. It was stable.</p>
<p>Leo’s song cut off. He swayed, dropping to one knee, the keystone’s
light dimming to an ember. Sweat dripped from his brow onto the dead
grass. He had not paid a memory. He had paid with sheer, exhausting
will. He had become a conduit, a temporary channel for balance.</p>
<p>He looked up at Alaric, breath ragged. “Not closure. A
<em>valve</em>. You don’t prevent the Recall by building a dam. You
prevent it by restoring the flow. By letting the lost things find their
way home, even if home is just peace. My grandfather wasn’t trying to
re-knit the realms. He was trying to re-weave the <em>paths</em> between
them. To let the pressure equalize. Balance, not amputation.”</p>
<p>Alaric’s blank face had finally cracked. Not with anger, but with a
profound, unsettling confusion. The arithmetic of his world was
crumbling. “The risk… the models…”</p>
<p>“Are based on fear,” Anais said, her voice clear as her threads. “You
remembered the prophecy, but you forgot what it means to be lost. You
forgot the longing.” She looked at me. “You forgot that a name, even
misplaced, is a compass point.”</p>
<p>The commander stood silent for a long moment. The other Guards
watched him, their pleasant masks now uncertain. The sterile, logical
edifice of his purpose had a Leo-shaped crack in it.</p>
<p>Then his eyes hardened. The confusion was swept away, filed under
‘anomaly to be corrected.’</p>
<p>“A fascinating demonstration,” he said. “A temporary stabilization at
immense personal cost. Not a scalable solution. The prophecy remains.
The risk is unacceptable.” He unclasped his hands. “We will take the
keystone. We will correct the discrepancy. And we will continue our
work.”</p>
<p>He gestured. The Oblivion Guard moved forward, their forms blurring,
becoming indistinct, like erasers smudging the world.</p>
<p>Leo pushed himself up. He looked at his grandfather in the amber. He
looked at the quiet, silver scar of the rift he had healed. He looked at
Anais, at me. He didn’t look at the advancing grey coats.</p>
<p>He made his choice.</p>
<p>He slammed the red keystone down onto the face of the compass.</p>
<p>There was no explosion. There was a <em>consumption</em>. The
keystone dissolved into a vortex of light, sucking into the compass. The
glass face shattered, but the needle spun, faster and faster, eating the
red glow, eating the black inert stone in his satchel too, a whirlwind
of obsidian and crimson dust. Leo held the disintegrating instruments,
his hands bleeding, his face a mask of agonized resolve. He wasn’t
destroying them. He was <em>fulfilling</em> them.</p>
<p>“You want the keystone?” he roared, his voice breaking. “Take
it!”</p>
<p>He thrust the swirling vortex of light and dust not at the Guards,
but at the ground between them—at the sigils binding the stasis
field.</p>
<p>The world turned inside out.</p>
<p>The amber light shattered. The hum became a deafening ring. The
figure within fell, and Leo was there, catching the old man’s weight
before he hit the ground.</p>
<p>And the clearing… remembered.</p>
<p>It remembered life. Not the preserved, beautiful death, but violent,
messy, <em>living</em> life. The dead grass at the rift’s edge sprouted
green, then grew, then <em>surged</em>, vines and flowers and thick,
tangling roots erupting from the ground. The petrified branches overhead
groaned, flexed, and sprouted real, whispering leaves. The crystal trees
resonated, singing a deep, tectonic note that shook the earth.</p>
<p>The Oblivion Guard stumbled, their grey coats suddenly vivid against
the riot of colour and sound. Their orderly erasure met the chaotic,
unstoppable force of a memory unleashed—not a single memory, but the
<em>idea</em> of memory, of return, of home.</p>
<p>Leo knelt, holding his grandfather, in the eye of the blooming storm.
He had paid the price. Not with a memory, but with his tools. With his
path. The Wayfinder had broken his compass to find true north.</p>
<p>Alaric stared, his hand outstretched, not in expectation now, but in
a kind of horrified awe. The world was not ending in a clean, quiet
erase. It was being <em>re-called</em> in the truest sense—shouted back
into existence by its own forgotten longing.</p>
<p>The old man in Leo’s arms stirred. His eyes fluttered open. They were
the colour of a storm sky. They found Leo’s face. Recognition, deep and
weary and warm, dawned in them.</p>
<p>“Took you long enough,” he croaked, his voice the sound of two stones
grinding together. “The bill’s come due, boy.”</p>
<p>Then his eyes rolled back. The surge of life around us faltered, the
green wave receding like a tide, leaving behind not sterility, but a
fragile, breathing equilibrium. The realm held. But it was tired.</p>
<p>And from the newly-living woods, a new sound came. Not the hum of
stasis, or the scream of static. But the deliberate, heavy tread of
boots. Many boots. And the cold, clear ring of steel being drawn.</p>
<p>The Oblivion Guard were not the only ones who’d been auditing the
accounts.</p>
<p>The Realmsguard had found the open door.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-12">Chapter 12</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-27"><strong>CHAPTER 27</strong></h2>
<p>The first thing I remembered was my own name. It wasn’t a dramatic,
sweeping revelation. It was more of a homecoming. A correction in the
ledger of the soul. I was standing in the museum’s central hall, the
grey dusk light the colour of forgotten silver, and a voice beside me
said, “God’s teeth, Leo. You’ve made a proper mess of the place.”</p>
<p>I turned. My grandfather, Alaric, was leaning on a display case that
now held a single, perfect leaf from a crystal oak. His face was still a
landscape of weary stone, but his eyes—the colour of a storm sky
<em>after</em> the rain—held a glint I’d never seen. He wasn’t missing
any teeth when he smirked.</p>
<p>“Well?” he said, gesturing with his chin at the hall around us. “Are
you curating, or are you conducting a philosophical symposium with the
dust motes?”</p>
<p><em>Leo.</em> Right. That was the name I’d been given. The one I’d
chosen. The one I’d broken a compass to earn.</p>
<p>The air still hummed with the aftermath of remembrance. The museum
was no longer a tomb for dead wonders; it was a convalescence ward for
miracles. In one corner, a vase from the Silent Realm occasionally
emitted a soft, chord-like sigh. In another, a tapestry from the Weeping
Citadel slowly un-ravelled its own depicted tears. The place was alive
with the gentle, erratic pulse of healing realms.</p>
<p>The Realmsguard had come through the door in the clearing not with
swords drawn for battle, but with tools for triage. Their commander, a
severe woman with hair the white of fresh parchment and eyes that held
entire archives, had taken one look at the blooming chaos, at Alaric
awake in my arms, and had sheathed her blade with a definitive
<em>click</em>.</p>
<p>“The account is not in deficit,” she had declared, her voice cutting
through the birdsong suddenly erupting from the newborn trees. “It is…
recalibrated.” She had looked at me, at the shattered compass in my
hand, its needle finally still. “You broke the instrument to stop
measuring. A costly, ill-advised, and fundamentally correct action. The
Oblivion Guard’s mandate was balance through subtraction. Ours is
balance through integration. You have given us something to
integrate.”</p>
<p>They had taken the stunned, grey-coated Oblivion Guard into
custody—not as prisoners, but as patients, their souls bleached by
too-long exposure to the static of unmaking. Then the commander had
turned to Alaric. “Custodian. Your stewardship was deemed lapsed. It
appears the report was premature.”</p>
<p>Alaric, leaning heavily on Kaela and me, had managed a dry cough.
“Interest compounded while I was… indisposed. The boy paid the
principle.”</p>
<p>“So we see. The sanctuary is reinstated. And expanded.” Her gaze
swept over the museum’s new, vibrant connection to the clearing. “This
locus is now a designated Crossroads. You will need help.”</p>
<p>And so they had stayed, a dozen Realmsguard, moving through our halls
with quiet efficiency, not erasing, but <em>assessing</em>, helping
Kaela and me gently corral the most volatile memories into stable
containers. They spoke in low tones of “mnemonic resonance” and
“conceptual bleed.” It was bureaucracy applied to the metaphysical, and
it was the only thing keeping the museum from vibrating itself
apart.</p>
<p>Now, days later, a fragile order prevailed. Kaela was in the artifact
annex, her hands wrapped in gloves of woven silence, negotiating with a
quarrelsome quill that kept writing insults in the air. The Realmsguard
were mostly in the field, helping the once-petrified forest remember how
to be a forest, not a monument.</p>
<p>Which left me and Alaric in the quiet heart of it all.</p>
<p>“A mess,” I agreed, looking at the leaf in the case. It was both
crystalline and supple, a memory of tree and a tree of memory. “But it’s
our mess.”</p>
<p>He grunted, pushing off the case and walking slowly toward the great
window overlooking the city. The ordinary, oblivious city. Lights were
coming on in windows, cars tracing rivers of red and white. The world,
unaware that its fragile, familiar reality was buttressed by a thousand
trembling, remembered ones.</p>
<p>“They told you the compass was for finding,” he said, his back to me.
“A tool to navigate the between-places. That was true. But it was never
for finding <em>places</em>, Leo.”</p>
<p>I joined him at the window. My reflection was faint, overlaid on the
cityscape. I looked tired. Older. The boy from the turnip field was a
ghost in that glass.</p>
<p>“What was it for, then?”</p>
<p>“It was for finding <em>perspective</em>,” he said. “For holding two
truths in one hand. The truth of what is, and the truth of what was, and
seeing the path that honours both. Most people, their minds are a
single, well-trodden road. Yours…” He tapped a finger against the glass,
over the image of my head. “Yours is a turnip field. Full of hidden,
unassuming things. And roads that go nowhere. And sky that looks like
dirty puddle-water.”</p>
<p>I felt a smile touch my lips. The opening line of my own story. A
misplacement. A clerical error.</p>
<p>“A flawed landscape,” I said.</p>
<p>“The only landscape that matters,” he corrected, his voice firm. “The
orderly mind sees a memory and files it. The chaotic mind sees a memory
and <em>feels</em> it. It gets lost in it. That’s what they feared.
That’s why the Oblivion Guard targeted places of high ‘mnemonic
density’—museums, libraries, old forests. They saw feeling as a
contagion. But feeling is the glue. You don’t remember your name by
filing it. You remember it by <em>feeling</em> it. By it feeling like
<em>you</em>.”</p>
<p>He turned to face me, and in his storm-sky eyes, I saw the young man
he’d been, the determined Custodian, and the weary prisoner he’d become,
all layered like the realms themselves.</p>
<p>“The compass was keyed to our bloodline, to a mind capable of holding
contradiction without breaking. But I… I began to see memory as a thing
to be <em>managed</em>. Preserved. I lost the feeling. The compass
stopped working for me because I was trying to use it to draw a map, not
to take a journey. You…” He reached out, his calloused hand gripping my
shoulder. “You broke it because the journey demanded you stop looking at
the needle and start looking at the horizon. You forgot the tool to
remember the purpose. That is what healed the rift. Not force. Not will.
<em>Empathy</em> for a forgotten world.”</p>
<p>The weight of his words, of his hand, settled into me. It wasn’t a
burden; it was an anchor. “So what is my purpose now? Here?”</p>
<p>Alaric’s gaze returned to the city. “The museum is no longer just a
repository. It’s a gateway. A sanctuary. The Realmsguard will help, but
theirs is the perspective of stewards. We are… translators. You and
Kaela. One who feels the memories, one who understands their
architecture. This place must become a school. Not for wizards. For
gardeners.”</p>
<p>“Gardeners?”</p>
<p>“Mnemonists. People who can tend the spaces between what is and what
was. Who can help a soul that’s forgotten its name find its way back,
without getting lost in the field.” He finally looked at me, a grim
humour in his eyes. “Starting, I suspect, with a number of confused
Oblivion Guards who need to relearn how to remember what they were
fighting for.”</p>
<p>The scope of it was terrifying. A lifetime’s work. More.</p>
<p>“And you?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I am the lesson of what happens when a gardener tries to become a
fence-builder,” he said, his voice rough. “I will tend my own plot. Help
you where I can. The ledger is in your hands now, Leo. See that you make
better marginalia than I did.”</p>
<p>He moved away then, leaving me at the window with the two cities—the
one of light and noise outside, and the one of memory and quiet miracle
behind me.</p>
<hr />
<p>Kaela found me there an hour later, the quill subdued and tucked into
a lead-lined box. She stood beside me, her shoulder not quite touching
mine. She smelled of ozone and old paper.</p>
<p>“He’s sleeping,” she said. “Actually sleeping. Not stasis. He snores.
It’s appalling.”</p>
<p>“Good,” I said.</p>
<p>We watched the city in silence for a long moment.</p>
<p>“A school for gardeners,” I said finally.</p>
<p>“I heard. I’ve already drafted a preliminary curriculum. Subject One:
Not All That Is Lost Should Stay That Way. Subject Two: The Care and
Feeding of Sentient Sadness.”</p>
<p>I glanced at her. Her profile was serene, but her eyes held that
fierce, calculating light. “You’re staying.”</p>
<p>She gave a small, definitive shrug. “The structural integrity of
inter-dimensional crossroads is the most fascinating puzzle imaginable.
Also, someone has to keep the literal ghosts in the machine from filing
everything under ‘miscellaneous anguish.’ You’ll handle the feelings.
I’ll handle the filing. Together, we’ll avoid clerical errors.”</p>
<p>The phrase resonated, deep and warm. <em>A clerical error in the
soul.</em> That’s what I’d thought I was. What I’d feared. But Kaela
made it sound like a job description. A necessary function.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” I said, the words utterly inadequate.</p>
<p>“Don’t,” she said, her voice soft. “You showed me a door in the air
where I only saw a wall. I’m just… exploring what’s on the other side.”
She nudged me with her elbow. “Come on. There’s a vase in the Ceramics
Wing that’s trying to remember a love poem. It’s terrible. It needs your
particular brand of empathetic wincing.”</p>
<hr />
<p>The final scene was not in the museum, nor in the remembered forest.
It was on a mundane sidewalk, under a streetlamp that buzzed with a
mundane fly, in the ordinary world.</p>
<p>I had to go back. To the apartment, to collect the last of my things.
To see the city not as a skyline from a magical window, but as pavement
under my shoes.</p>
<p>I walked. And I remembered.</p>
<p>I remembered the turnip field. The grey dawn. The man with the potato
face and the missing teeth, whose name I suddenly knew was Gerth. A
lonely, bitter man who hated the world for being as barren as he felt. I
remembered the feeling of the cool, damp earth, the weight of the
forgotten turnip in my hand. The profound, unshakable sense of being
<em>misplaced</em>.</p>
<p>But now, the memory had context. It was no longer a prison of
confusion. It was the first page. The call to a journey I hadn’t
understood.</p>
<p>I passed a newsstand, the headlines shouting about politics and
sports. I passed a café where someone laughed, a bright, uncomplicated
sound. I passed a small, neglected park where a single oak tree stood,
its leaves whispering secrets only I could now fully appreciate.</p>
<p>I was not Emeric, the useless farmhand. I was not just Leo, the
confused young man. I was the Custodian of the Crossroads. The gardener
of memory. My mind was not a flaw; it was the necessary soil.</p>
<p>I reached my old apartment building. The foyer light was flickering.
I climbed the stairs, each step a beat in the rhythm of my old, ordinary
life. At my door, I paused. I could leave it all behind. The keys, the
faded couch, the life that no longer fit.</p>
<p>But I didn’t. I went in. I stood in the quiet, dim space. It held
memories, too. Small, human ones. Lonely nights. Quiet hopes. The smell
of cheap coffee. They were not epic. They were not realm-shattering.
They were mine.</p>
<p>This was part of the balance, too. Not just tending the miraculous,
but honouring the mundane. The memory of a lonely boy in a city was as
sacred as the memory of a crystal forest. One gave the other
meaning.</p>
<p>I gathered a few last items: a photograph of my parents, their faces
smiling and forever still; a well-worn book; the small, smooth stone I’d
kept from a beach as a child. The artifacts of a single, human soul.</p>
<p>As I turned to leave, my eye caught the world outside my window. The
same cityscape, but from a lower, poorer angle. The same lights. The
same endless, humming life.</p>
<p>And I understood Alaric’s final lesson. The compass was for
perspective. To hold two truths. The truth of the magical world
thrumming at the edge of sight, and the truth of this one, with its
flickering foyer lights and its lonely parks. The path was not in
choosing one over the other. The path was in walking both, in letting
each remember the other.</p>
<p>I was the bridge. Not a grand, architectural marvel, but a simple,
steadfast thing. A path over a quiet stream. A gate in a low stone
wall.</p>
<p>I locked the door to my old life for the last time and walked back
down the stairs. The flickering light in the foyer steadied, just for a
moment, as I passed beneath it.</p>
<p>Outside, the air was cool. The night was deep. I walked back toward
the museum, not with the frantic urgency of a quest, but with the steady
pace of a man going to work. My work.</p>
<p>In my pocket, my fingers brushed the smooth stone from the beach, and
the cold key to the museum’s side door. Two truths. One hand.</p>
<p>The first thing I remembered was my own name. It was Leo. It was
Custodian. It was Gardener. It was the boy from the turnip field who
finally understood that the field was not a wasteland, but the place
where things grow, hidden until they are ready to be found.</p>
<p>The museum’s towers came into view, silhouetted against the night
sky. A light was on in Alaric’s window. Another in Kaela’s workroom. A
beacon. A home.</p>
<p>I crossed the threshold, from the ordinary street into the remembered
garden. The air shifted, tasting of ozone and old roses. Somewhere, a
vase recited a terrible, beautiful love poem. Somewhere, a leaf of
crystal and chlorophyll caught the starlight.</p>
<p>I closed the door behind me. Not to shut the world out, but to weave
it in.</p>
<p>The work was just beginning. And I was not misplaced. I was, for the
first time, precisely where I was meant to be.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-13">Chapter 13</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-13-1"><strong>CHAPTER 13</strong></h2>
<p>The first thing I remembered was the weight of a key. It was a cold,
deliberate pressure in my palm, a counterpoint to the warm, worn stone
from the beach. Two truths. One hand. I stood in the museum’s grand
foyer, the door to the ordinary street closed at my back, and the
silence was not an absence, but a presence. It was the hum of a held
breath.</p>
<p>The light in Alaric’s window was a smudge of honey against the indigo
glass of the ceiling dome. The one in Kaela’s workroom was a sharper,
silver-blue. Beacons. I did not go to them. The work was not up there,
not tonight. The work was here, in the gut of the place. I was the
bridge, the path, the gate. A gate must know its own hinges.</p>
<p>I walked past the whispering vase, which had moved on from love poems
to a mournful dirge about a lost teaspoon. The sound of my boots on the
marble was a steady, familiar punctuation. <em>Custodian. Gardener.
Leo.</em> The names were not separate. They were layers, like the strata
of paint on an old wall, each necessary to hold the picture.</p>
<p>My feet took me to the Hall of Unfinished Symphonies. It was always a
good place to think. The air here tasted of resin and potential, the
ghost-notes of melodies that had never found their final chord hanging
like cobwebs. I sat on a bench carved with musical staves, the stone
cold through my trousers. I took the stone and the key from my pocket,
laying them side by side on the bench.</p>
<p>The stone was from the beach where I had first properly remembered,
where the sea had whispered <em>Leo</em> back into my bones. The key was
from Alaric, for the side door, for the work. One was a memory of
becoming. The other was a tool for being.</p>
<p>A soft scuff of leather on stone. I did not look up. I knew the
cadence of those footsteps.</p>
<p>“You have the look of a man conducting an inventory,” Alaric said. He
settled on the bench beside me, his presence a comfortable, angular
shadow. He smelled of ink and ozone.</p>
<p>“Of a soul,” I corrected, my voice quiet in the hall’s acoustic.
“Trying to understand the filing system.”</p>
<p>He chuckled, a dry, papery sound. “Ah. A lifelong endeavour. And a
futile one. The soul is not a ledger. It is more of a… disorganised
archive. A delightful mess. The trick is not to file, but to know how to
retrieve what you need, when you need it.”</p>
<p>I nudged the stone with a finger. “This feels like a retrieval. The
key feels like a… directive.”</p>
<p>“They are the same thing,” he said. “The memory tells you who you
are. The key tells you what to do with it. One without the other is just
sentiment, or just labour. Together…” He gestured vaguely, encompassing
the hall, the museum, the world beyond its walls. “Together, they are
the work.”</p>
<p>We sat in a silence that was not empty. A faint, sorrowful violin
phrase looped in a distant corner, three bars long, repeating
endlessly.</p>
<p>“I crossed the threshold,” I said. “I closed the door. I understand
the theory. Two worlds. The bridge. But a bridge has two ends. I know
this end.” I looked at him. “The other end… the turnip field, the dirty
dawn, Baldric’s missing teeth… it’s still there, isn’t it? It didn’t
vanish because I remembered my name.”</p>
<p>Alaric’s face grew still, his eyes reflecting the dim ambient light
like chips of wet slate. “No. It did not vanish. That is the most
important thing to understand, Leo. The field does not vanish. The rent
is still due to Sir Guy on Thursday. The other truth does not cease to
be true because you have learned to see this one. That is the burden and
the balance.”</p>
<p>“Baldric called me Emeric,” I said. The name felt like a suit of
clothes I had outgrown, the seams tight, the fabric thin. “Is he
wrong?”</p>
<p>“Is a turnip wrong for being a turnip?” Alaric sighed. “He sees the
shape that was placed in that world. A young man, somewhat slow, prone
to staring at vegetables. That is a truth. Your truth is larger, now. It
contains his, but it is not contained by it. You are both Emeric the
turnip-farmer and Leo the Custodian. The bridge must be anchored on both
sides, or it is merely a pier extending into nothing.”</p>
<p>The violin phrase hiccupped, tried a fourth bar, and fell back into
its three-bar loop.</p>
<p>“So I have to go back,” I said. The thought was a cold stone in my
gut, different from the one in my hand.</p>
<p>“Not <em>have to</em>,” Alaric said. “<em>Must</em>. The rent is due
Thursday. That is a fact in that world. Ignoring facts in one world has
consequences in both. Magic is not an escape. It is a responsibility.
You tend the garden here. You must also tend the plot there. The magic
will seep into the cracks, otherwise. It will grow wild. And wild magic
in a turnip field… well. You’ve seen what a mis-remembered verse did to
a vase. Imagine a mis-remembered turnip.”</p>
<p>I saw it. A tuberous, pulsating thing with too many eyes, whispering
Baldric’s grievances in a high, reedy voice. A grim smile touched my
lips. “It would complain about my work ethic.”</p>
<p>“Precisely. Nuisance magic. The worst kind. It attracts attention
from the wrong sorts. From the hollow men, the tidiers, the ones who
would rather prune a world into sterile order than let it grow in its
own messy, glorious way.” He stood, his joints giving a soft pop. “You
will go tomorrow. At dawn. The time of dirty puddles. You will pay Sir
Guy his silver. You will be Emeric. And you will remember that you are
Leo.”</p>
<p>He left me then, his footsteps fading into the symphony of the
museum’s night. I picked up the key and the stone. The directive and the
retrieval. I closed my fist around them. The metal bit. The stone
comforted.</p>
<hr />
<p>The dawn, when it came, was the colour of a dirty puddle.</p>
<p>I stood at the museum’s side door, the key unused in my pocket. I had
walked out through the main entrance, through the remembered garden that
faded seamlessly into the city park. The transition was smooth now, a
conscious step from one truth to another. I wore the rough-spun trousers
and tunic of Emeric, clothes that had been waiting in a chest in my
room, smelling of lye and earth. They felt both alien and familiar, like
a skin I had shed and now had to put back on.</p>
<p>The walk to the outskirts was a study in duality. I saw the city with
a double exposure. The flickering neon sign of a chip shop was also, for
a fleeting second, a rune of preservation etched in cold fire. The
grumble of the early bus was the deep chord of a sleeping earth
elemental. I let the impressions come and go, not clinging to them, not
denying them. The bridge.</p>
<p>The fields began where the pavement gave way to rutted mud. The air
lost the taste of exhaust and gained the smell of damp soil and rotting
leaves. My feet knew the way. They carried me down a lane hedged with
bare, thorny branches, to a small, mean cottage of wattle and daub
slumped beside a stone barn. Smoke struggled from a hole in the
thatch.</p>
<p>Baldric was in the yard, milking a goat that looked as disappointed
as he did. He glanced up, his potato-face settling into its default
expression of profound dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>“You’re late,” he said, his voice a gravelly accusation. “Dreaming
again? The turnips won’t harvest themselves, Emeric. Though God knows
you try to make them.”</p>
<p>“I’m here,” I said. The voice that came out was flatter, softer than
Leo’s. It fit the clothes. “Here isn’t in the field,” he grumbled, but
the fight was routine, not real. He jerked his head toward the barn.
“Spade’s where you left it. Get to it. I’ve got to take the cheese to
market. The silver won’t earn itself.”</p>
<p>I fetched the wooden spade. Its handle was smooth from use, from the
grip of Emeric’s hands. <em>My hands.</em> I walked to the field. The
turnips were a series of ragged green tufts in the black earth. The sky
was a wide, oppressive blanket of grey.</p>
<p>I drove the spade into the ground. The shock travelled up my arms. It
was a real feeling, solid and undeniable. <em>This is true.</em> I
worked. The rhythm was mechanical, hypnotic. Lift, turn, thump. Lift,
turn, thump. My mind began to quiet, the noise of the museum fading
under the sheer physical truth of the labour. The cold air. The ache in
my lower back. The dirt under my nails.</p>
<p>This was the other anchor. This was the truth of blisters and hunger
and a rent due to a man who owned the ground you broke your back upon.
It was a small, hard truth. But it was true.</p>
<p>I was Emeric. I was harvesting turnips. For a long stretch of time,
that was all I was.</p>
<p>A memory surfaced, not as a vision, but as a flavour. The taste of
ozone and old roses. It was so vivid it made me pause, spade
half-lifted. I was both here, in the field, and there, in the hall of
whispering artefacts. The bridge. I held both. The blisters and the
roses.</p>
<p>I worked until my pile of turnips was respectable, then I hauled the
sack to the barn. Baldric had returned from market, his cart empty. He
counted the turnips with a critical eye, grunted what might have been
approval, and handed me two small, grimy silver coins.</p>
<p>“For Sir Guy,” he said, as if I might mistake their purpose. “Don’t
lose them. Don’t dally. Go straight to the manor, give them to Steward
Jarvis, and come straight back. There’s a fence needs mending.”</p>
<p>I took the coins. They were cold, heavier than they looked. The
weight of this world.</p>
<p>The walk to Sir Guy’s manor was a mile along a muddy track. The manor
was not a castle, but a fortified house of grim grey stone, squatting on
a low hill like a brooding toad. The gate was iron, rusting at the
hinges. A bored guard in a leather jerkin waved me through to the
yard.</p>
<p>Steward Jarvis was a man made of angles and vinegar. He stood on the
steps to the main door, a wax tablet in his hands, his nose perpetually
wrinkled as if smelling something foul. He took the coins from my palm
without touching my skin.</p>
<p>“Emeric,” he stated. He made a mark on his tablet. “Baldric’s rent.
On time for once. A miracle.” His eyes, pale and watery, flicked over
me. “You’re less vacant than usual. Finally growing into your wits, such
as they are?”</p>
<p>I said nothing. Emeric was not a talker. I met his gaze for a second,
then looked at the ground, at the churned mud of the yard. It was the
expected response.</p>
<p>“Hmph. Off with you,” he said, turning away, already dismissing me
from his reality.</p>
<p>I turned to go. And as I turned, I saw it. A flicker at an upper
window. A face, pale and long, framed by dark hair. It was there for
only a moment, a glimpse of eyes that seemed too large, too dark, before
a curtain twitched shut.</p>
<p>The sight was a pinprick of wrongness. A dissonant note. It was not
magical, not in the museum-sense. It was a human wrongness. A feeling of
being watched from a place of quiet dread. It was a truth from this
world, but it resonated with a frequency I knew from the other. It was
the feeling of a held breath, of a silent scream trapped behind
glass.</p>
<p>I walked back to the lane, the image seared into my mind. The face
was young, a woman’s face. And it was afraid.</p>
<p>The fence-mending was a blur of rough wood and twisted wire. My hands
performed the task, but my mind was elsewhere. In the museum, artefacts
held memory, emotion, history. They thrummed with it. That house on the
hill thrummed with something too. Not magic, but misery. A thick, cold
misery that seeped into its stones.</p>
<p>At supper—a thin stew of turnip and barley—Baldric was in a rare,
almost conversational mood, brought on by the successful rent
payment.</p>
<p>“Seen the ghost up at the manor, then?” he said around a mouthful of
bread.</p>
<p>I looked up. “Ghost?”</p>
<p>“Aye. Lady Eleanor, they say. Sir Guy’s daughter. Mad as a moonstruck
hare. Locked in the west tower these ten years. You hear her sometimes,
wailing. Jarvis says it’s the wind in the chimneys.” He snorted. “Jarvis
says a lot of things. Wind doesn’t sound like a woman’s heart
breaking.”</p>
<p>“Why is she locked away?” I asked. The question was Leo’s, not
Emeric’s. It came out too direct.</p>
<p>Baldric gave me a sharp look. “Since when do you care about manor
gossip? She was promised. Betrothed. To some lord’s son from over the
mountains. Then she… changed. Started saying she saw things. Heard
things in the walls. Refused the match. Shamed her father. So she’s
ill. Needs quiet. That’s the story.” He shrugged, his interest already
waning. “Not our business. Our business is turnips and rent. Remember
that, Emeric. Stick to your business.”</p>
<p>I nodded, looking back into my bowl. <em>She saw things. Heard
things.</em> The words echoed. A woman in a tower, seeing what others
could not. It was a story from this world, but it brushed against the
edges of mine. A soul, perhaps, sensitive to the memories in the stones,
to the whispers of a world thrumming at the edge of sight. Untrained.
Unbelieved. Driven mad by truths she could not name or share.</p>
<p>That night, in the narrow, straw-stuffed pallet in the cottage loft,
I held the warm stone from the beach. The memory of the sea, of my name,
of the other truth. The face at the window superimposed itself over the
memory. The bridge was not just between my two selves. It was between
all the seen and unseen things. Between the forgotten and the
remembered.</p>
<p>A woman was imprisoned for seeing. I was a man who had been lost for
forgetting.</p>
<p>The work, it seemed, was not just in the museum.</p>
<hr />
<p>I returned to the museum the next evening, as the dirty puddle dawn
gave way to a dirty puddle dusk. The transition back was a relief, a
shedding of the too-tight Emeric skin. The air in the grand foyer was
clean, sharp, humming with latent life.</p>
<p>Kaela found me first. She was in the conservatory, her hands
wrist-deep in a pot of soil that sparkled with minuscule crystals. She
looked up, her green eyes missing nothing.</p>
<p>“You smell of cold earth and unresolved narrative,” she said.</p>
<p>“Turnips and tyranny,” I replied, leaning against a workbench. The
scent of growing things here was verdant and powerful, not the meek
smell of the field.</p>
<p>“Ah. The other anchor. How was the weather in the land of literal
roots?”</p>
<p>“Grey. And there’s a ghost in a tower.”</p>
<p>Her hands stilled. “A real one? Or a metaphor for aristocratic
oppression?”</p>
<p>“A woman. Sir Guy’s daughter. They say she’s mad. She sees things.” I
told her about the face, Baldric’s story. “It feels… adjacent. To our
work.”</p>
<p>Kaela wiped her hands on a cloth, her expression turning serious, the
usual playful light in her eyes banked. “Adjacent. Yes. The world is
full of cracks, Leo. Most people walk right over them. Some… some fall
in. They catch glimpses of the deeper architecture, the memories in the
mortar. Without a framework, without someone to say ‘yes, that is real,
and this is how you live with it,’ it can break a mind. It’s not magic
that harms them. It’s the loneliness of the truth.”</p>
<p>“She’s a prisoner for it,” I said, the anger a quiet ember in my
chest.</p>
<p>“Many are,” Alaric said from the doorway. He held two mugs of
steaming tea. He handed one to me. It smelled of chamomile and something
sharper, like starlight. “Prisons take many forms. Towers. Ideas. The
conviction that one is alone. Your turnip-field baron imprisons his
daughter for seeing. The hollow men would imprison entire worlds for not
being tidy enough. It is the same impulse, scaled differently.”</p>
<p>I took the mug, the heat seeping into my bones. “What do we do?”</p>
<p>“We tend the garden,” Alaric said softly. “We remember. And
sometimes, tending means noticing a blight on a neighbouring tree. Not
to tear it down, but to understand its nature. To see if it can be
healed, or if it must be isolated to protect the rest of the grove.”</p>
<p>“I want to see her,” I said. The words were out before I had fully
thought them. “Not as Emeric. As… me. To see what she sees.”</p>
<p>Alaric and Kaela exchanged a look. It was not refusal. It was
assessment.</p>
<p>“It is a risk,” Alaric said. “To you. To her. To the balance. You are
still learning to hold your own two truths. Introducing a third… it is
unstable ground.”</p>
<p>“She’s already in unstable ground,” I said. “She’s falling through
the cracks. Isn’t that what a bridge is for? To span cracks?”</p>
<p>Kaela smiled, a slow, bright thing. “He’s got you there, old
man.”</p>
<p>Alaric sipped his tea, his gaze distant, seeing layers of reality I
could only guess at. “The rent is paid. Emeric has no further business
at the manor. You would need a reason. A delivery. An offering.”</p>
<p>“An offering from whom?” I asked.</p>
<p>“From the Gardener to the forgotten flower,” Kaela said. She went to
a shelf and took down a small, plain clay pot. In it was a single,
unassuming plant with velvety grey-green leaves. “Lungwort,” she said.
“Flecked like a diseased lung, which is how it got its name. The vulgar
truth. But it is also called ‘Mary’s Tears’ or ‘Jerusalem Cowslip’. It
remembers a time when it was used to speak to spirits of the air, to
calm frantic hearts. It holds the memory of compassion. It is a bridge
between a harsh truth and a gentle one.”</p>
<p>She placed it in my hands. The leaves were soft, cool. The plant had
no aura, no shimmer. It was quiet. Profoundly quiet.</p>
<p>“Take this to her,” Alaric said. “As a supplicant. A herbalist’s boy,
perhaps, sent by a wise woman with a remedy for melancholy. It will get
you to the tower. What happens then… will depend on you. And on her. You
must listen, Leo. Not as a Custodian imposing order, but as a Gardener
tending a wild, fragile thing. Can you do that?”</p>
<p>I looked at the plant. It was just a plant. It was a key. It was a
memory of kindness. Two truths. One hand.</p>
<p>“I can try,” I said.</p>
<p>“Then go at twilight tomorrow,” Alaric said. “The hour of in-between.
Where shadows are longest, and the veil between what is and what is
remembered is thin.”</p>
<hr />
<p>The following twilight found me on the manor road again, but not as
Emeric. I wore simpler, cleaner clothes, a healer’s apprentice smock
Kaela had produced from somewhere. I carried the clay pot of lungwort.
The light was the colour of bruised lilac, leaching the world of
solidity.</p>
<p>The guard at the gate was different, older, with a sagging face.
“State your business.”</p>
<p>“Herbs for the Lady Eleanor,” I said, my voice low, respectful. “From
Mother Elsewith, for the calming of spirits.”</p>
<p>The guard’s eyes widened slightly. Superstition warred with routine.
“No one sees the lady. Jarvis’s orders.”</p>
<p>“The gift is for her maid, then. To place in her chamber. For the
miasma.” I used the word Baldric had muttered. The guard frowned, but
the fear of illness, of bad air, of something <em>catching</em>, won
out. He waved me through with a grunt.</p>
<p>Jarvis was not in the yard. A scullery maid, her arms red from
washing, pointed me to a narrow, moss-grown door at the base of the west
tower when I whispered my errand. Her eyes were wide with fearful
sympathy.</p>
<p>The tower door was unlocked. It opened onto a spiral staircase of
worn stone, smelling of damp and dust and something else—a faint,
metallic tang of despair. I began to climb. The only light came from
arrow-slits, casting slanted, fading bars on the steps.</p>
<p>At the top was a heavy oak door, banded with iron. A small, grilled
window was set at eye-level. I stood before it, my heart a slow, heavy
drum. I could hear nothing from within.</p>
<p>I raised a hand and knocked, softly.</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>Then, a rustle. A whisper of fabric on stone. A pale shape filled the
grill. The large, dark eyes I had seen from the yard. They were not
vacant. They were terrifyingly, painfully aware.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” The voice was a thread of sound, dry and cracked from
disuse.</p>
<p>“A friend,” I said, the word feeling both true and impossibly
inadequate. “I brought you something. A plant. It remembers
quietness.”</p>
<p>“A plant,” she echoed. A ghost of a laugh, bitter as wormwood. “Does
it remember how to unlock doors?”</p>
<p>“No,” I said. “But it remembers how to be seen. Truly seen.”</p>
<p>Her eyes searched mine through the grill. The scrutiny was intense,
peeling back layers. I did not look away. I let her see Leo. I let her
see the bridge.</p>
<p>“You are not from here,” she whispered. “You are from the other
place. The place behind the walls.”</p>
<p>My breath caught. “You can see it?”</p>
<p>“I hear it,” she said, her forehead pressing against the iron. “In
the stones. They whisper. All day, all night. Memories of fires. Of
blood. Of laughter. They never stop. He says I am mad. The doctor bled
me to quiet the humours. But it is not in my blood. It is in the
<em>world</em>.” Her voice broke on the last word, a sob of sheer,
exhausted terror.</p>
<p>“You are not mad,” I said, the words firm, an anchor thrown into her
storm. “The world is… layered. Like a story written over and over on the
same parchment. You are hearing the older writing. The palimpsest.”</p>
<p>She was silent for a long moment. “A palimpsest,” she repeated,
tasting the word. “Yes. That is it. Scraped clean but never quite gone.
You know this. You believe it.”</p>
<p>“I know it,” I said. “I work in a place that cares for such things.
For the older writing.”</p>
<p>A thin, trembling hand appeared at the grill, fingers pale as bone.
“The plant.”</p>
<p>I passed the small clay pot through the bars. Her fingers brushed
mine. They were ice-cold. She took it, drew it inside, held it close to
her face, inhaling.</p>
<p>“It is quiet,” she murmured, wonder in her voice. “It… it doesn’t
whisper. It just… is.”</p>
<p>“It holds the memory of silence,” I said. “Of peace. You can hold
onto that, when the other whispers grow too loud. It is a true thing.
Let it be your true thing.”</p>
<p>She looked at me, and for the first time, the crushing fear in her
eyes receded, just a fraction. Not gone, but joined by something else. A
fragile, desperate hope. “Will you come back?”</p>
<p>The question was a hook, sinking deep. It was a responsibility. A
thread connecting my world to hers, to this tower of misery. It was not
in the plan. But the work was not about plans. It was about tending.</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said. The promise was a stone dropped into a well, its
consequences rippling out into the dark. “I will come back.”</p>
<p>A heavy tread sounded on the stairs below. Jarvis’s voice, sharp and
suspicious, echoed up the shaft. “Who’s there? Who is at the lady’s
door?”</p>
<p>I gave Eleanor one last look. She clutched the pot to her chest, her
eyes wide again, but now with warning for me, not just fear for
herself.</p>
<p>“Remember the quiet,” I whispered.</p>
<p>I turned and descended quickly, meeting Jarvis halfway. His face was
a mask of outraged authority.</p>
<p>“You! What is the meaning of this? I gave no permission!”</p>
<p>“The herb, steward,” I said, dipping my head. “For the lady’s miasma.
The guard admitted me.”</p>
<p>“You will leave. Now. And you will not return. If you are seen near
this manor again, you will be flogged for trespass.” He grabbed my arm,
his fingers digging in, and marched me down the stairs, through the
yard, and thrust me out of the gate into the gathering dark.</p>
<p>I stood on the road, the memory of her fingers on mine, the weight of
her hope, colder than the silver rent in my pocket. The bridge I was
building had just extended to a prison tower. I had promised to
return.</p>
<p>And Jarvis’s eyes, as he pushed me out, had held not just anger, but
a flicker of something else. A recognition, perhaps, that I was not what
I seemed. A new variable in his controlled, miserable little world.</p>
<p>I walked back toward the museum, the twilight deepening into proper
night. The work was no longer just about remembering myself, or tending
magical artefacts. It was about a woman in a tower who heard the
memories in the stones. It was about a steward who would protect his
lord’s shame at any cost. It was about a bridge that now had to bear a
new, fragile weight.</p>
<p>The first thing I remembered was my own name. But now, I also
remembered hers. Eleanor. A forgotten truth, waiting in the dark.</p>
<p>And I had promised to remember her.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-14">Chapter 14</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-14-1"><strong>CHAPTER 14</strong></h2>
<p>The road back to the museum was a dark ribbon, the memory of her
touch a brand on my skin. The cold silver in my pocket was a dead
weight, but the promise I had made was heavier, a lodestone in my chest
pulling me toward the tower. Jarvis’s fingers had left bruises, a
constellation of proprietary anger on my arm. I studied them in the thin
moonlight. They were my bruises. I was the man who had earned them. The
clarity of that fact was a strange comfort.</p>
<p>The museum loomed ahead, a deeper black against the black sky. No
light showed from Mrs. Bambleby’s quarters. The whole world seemed to
have been emptied into a cup of silence. I let myself in through the
side door, the groan of the hinge a confession in the dark.</p>
<p>I did not go to my pallet. I went to the Hall of Ephemera.</p>
<p>The air there was different. It was not the dead quiet of a tomb, but
the listening quiet of a held breath. The artefacts slept, their dreams
humming at a frequency just below hearing. I walked past the case of
thimbles, past the box of broken seals, to the far wall. There, on a
simple oak stand, was the Bridal Veil of the Lady of Crows.</p>
<p>It was not a veil, not really. It was a length of aged linen, the
colour of weak tea, so fine it was almost sheer. It was said she wore it
when they walled her into the convent cellar for her heresies, that she
breathed through it until the air was gone. It held no grand magic, no
stored lightning or bottled sorrow. Its power was subtler. It was a
filter for truth.</p>
<p>I did not touch it. I stood before it, my own breath slowing to match
the quiet of the room.</p>
<p>“I met a woman who hears stone,” I said, the words barely a whisper.
They were not for the veil. They were for the act of speaking them
aloud, of giving shape to the new, fragile architecture of my world.
“She is a prisoner in her own home. She tends a pot of earth. She
remembers being forgotten.”</p>
<p>The veil did not stir. But the pressure in the room shifted, the way
air moves before a distant storm. The truth of Eleanor was not a simple
thing. It was layered, like the strata of the cliff below her window.
There was the truth of her confinement. The truth of her gift. The truth
of Sir Guy’s shame. And the truth of my promise, which was now a part of
all the others.</p>
<p>I was not just Emeric, the turnip-farmer’s brother, the museum’s
odd-job man. I was the man who had spoken to the woman in the tower. I
was a variable. Jarvis had seen it. I had felt the click of recognition
in his grip, the adjustment of a man recalculating a threat.</p>
<p>The work was no longer just tending. It was navigating.</p>
<p>I finally slept, but it was a thin and restless sleep. I dreamed of
roots. Not turnip roots, but deep, ancient roots, gnarled and pushing
against the foundations of stone towers. They were silent, but their
pressure was a sound you felt in your teeth.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bambleby was at the kitchen table when I entered the next
morning, dissecting a kipper with surgical precision. She did not look
up.</p>
<p>“You were out late,” she said, spearing a fragment of bone.</p>
<p>“An errand,” I said.</p>
<p>“To Blackfield Manor.” It was not a question. Her eyes, when she
finally raised them, were the colour of flint. “Jarvis the steward sent
a boy at dawn. A message.”</p>
<p>My blood became a slow, cold slurry in my veins. “What was the
message?”</p>
<p>She wiped her fingers on a cloth. “That you are not to return. That
you are forbidden from approaching the manor walls. That you are a
disruptive influence.” She said the last phrase as if it were a foreign
term for a rare disease. “He was quite emphatic. The boy looked
terrified.”</p>
<p>I fetched a heel of bread from the cupboard. My hands were steady.
That was something. “The lady is unwell. I was delivering an herb.”</p>
<p>“An herb.” Mrs. Bambleby let the words hang. “The Lady Eleanor. Sir
Guy’s daughter. A tragic story. A fever of the brain after her mother’s
death. She lives in seclusion. For her own peace.” She recited it like a
parish notice. Then her gaze sharpened, drilling into the space between
my eyes. “Is that what you saw? A brain-fevered girl?”</p>
<p>I saw the clean line of her part, the intelligence in her eyes, the
fierce protectiveness over a pot of silent earth. I saw the calculated
cruelty of a beautiful room that was a cage. “I saw a prisoner,” I
said.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bambleby gave a short, satisfied nod, as if I had passed a test.
“Jarvis is a custodian of shame. He tends it like a prize rose. He will
not like you digging in that particular garden.” She pushed her plate
away. “Sir Guy is in London. Has been for months. Jarvis rules the
roost. And he has the right, by law and by custom, to flog a trespassing
labourer.”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>“Then you will be careful.” She stood, her chair scraping on the
flagstones. “The rent is still due Thursday. Do not let your new hobby
distract from your obligations. A flogging is one thing. Debtor’s prison
is another.”</p>
<p>She left for the public rooms. I stood in the kitchen, the weight of
the two silvers in my pocket now bifurcated. One for Sir Guy. One for a
promise. Both demanded my presence at the very place I was now forbidden
to go.</p>
<p>The day’s work was a pantomime. I swept floors that did not need
sweeping. I dusted cases with a mindless rhythm. My body was in the Hall
of Grandeur, polishing the display of ceremonial daggers, but my mind
was in the tower, tracing the path I had taken, the sound of Jarvis’s
boots on the stairs, the look in Eleanor’s eyes as I promised to
return.</p>
<p>I had built a bridge of words. Jarvis had burned it. A bridge made of
stone and shadow would be harder to see.</p>
<p>That evening, after the last visitor had shuffled out and
Mrs. Bambleby had retired with her ledger, I went to the basement. It
was a cavern of forgotten clutter, the museum’s subconscious. Broken
furniture, cracked display stands, piles of mildewed pamphlets. And, in
a corner, under a waxed canvas sheet, my own private project.</p>
<p>I pulled the sheet away.</p>
<p>It was a cabinet, about the height of my waist, made of a dark,
close-grained wood. It was not beautiful. It was sturdy. I had built it
from scraps, piecing it together like a memory. It had no lock. Instead,
it had a series of seven small, wooden slides set into the frame of the
door. They had to be moved in a specific sequence—left, right, up, down,
a tactile pattern—for the hidden latch to release. I had designed it
that winter, my fingers learning the pattern before my mind could recall
why it felt so essential. A memory in muscle, not in thought.</p>
<p>I ran my fingers over the slides, performing the sequence. A soft
<em>click</em>. The door swung open.</p>
<p>Inside were my tools. Not a spade or a broom. A set of fine, steel
lock-picks I had forged from a broken clock spring. A coil of dark,
strong cord. A small bottle of oil that smelled of almonds. A roll of
black cloth. A knife with a blade as thin as a whisper. And, wrapped in
a piece of felt, the smooth, cool disc of a silver mirror no larger than
my palm.</p>
<p>I had no memory of acquiring these things. I had simply, over the
months, felt the need to make them, to find them, to hide them here. As
if some part of me, the part that remembered before the turnip field,
was preparing for a life that had not yet arrived.</p>
<p>It had arrived now.</p>
<p>I took the coil of cord, the bottle of oil, and the black cloth. I
did not take the picks. Not yet. This was not a mission of entry. It was
a mission of observation. Of learning the rhythms of a prison’s
keep.</p>
<p>The night was clear and cold, the moon a shaving of bone. I took a
wide berth around the village, sticking to the hedgerows and frozen
ditches. I was a shadow among shadows. The act of moving with intent,
with silence, felt like speaking a language I had forgotten I knew. My
breath plumed in the air, a ghostly companion.</p>
<p>I came upon Blackfield Manor from the north, through the skeletal
woods that crowned the hill behind it. From here, I could look down on
the complex: the main house with its slumbering windows, the
outbuildings, the walled yard, the tower.</p>
<p>A light burned in Eleanor’s window.</p>
<p>It was a small, defiant glow. I watched it for a long time, until the
cold had seeped through my boots and into my bones. I saw a shadow pass
before the candle once, twice. A slow, pacing rhythm. She was awake. She
was waiting.</p>
<p>My eyes traced the tower’s stone skin. It was not sheer. Centuries of
weathering, of repairs, had left a tapestry of holds: protruding stones,
gaps in the mortar, the thick sinew of ivy stems, bare now but still
clinging. It was not a climb for a farmer. But it was a climb for the
man who had built the cabinet, whose hands knew the weight of the thin
knife.</p>
<p>A heavier shadow detached itself from the stable block and moved
across the yard. Jarvis. He carried a lantern, its light swinging in a
short, impatient arc. He stopped below the tower, looked up at Eleanor’s
light, and stood there for a full minute, a statue of disapproval. Then
he turned and walked to the guard post by the gate. I saw him speak to
the man there, a gesture toward the woods, toward the road. Reinforcing
the order. <em>Watch for him.</em></p>
<p>He did not think in terms of ivy and stone. He thought in terms of
gates and roads. That was a weakness.</p>
<p>I spent two more nights in the woods. I learned the guards’
rounds—there were only two, and they were lazy, clustering near the
gatehouse brazier. I learned that Jarvis made his final inspection at
midnight, a circuit of the yard, always ending with that long, upward
stare at the tower light. I learned the best path through the woods,
where the dry leaves were fewest, where the frozen stream masked
sound.</p>
<p>On the third day, Thursday, rent day, I presented myself at the manor
gate in the flat light of afternoon. The same guard from before was
there, but his affable confusion was gone. His face hardened.</p>
<p>“You’re not allowed.”</p>
<p>“I have the rent,” I said, holding up the silver coin. “For Sir Guy.
It is due today.”</p>
<p>The guard shifted, conflict on his broad face. Duty to orders warred
with duty to rent. Rent won. He opened the gate a crack. “Give it here.
I’ll see it gets to the steward.”</p>
<p>“My brother-in-law said I must put it in the steward’s hand myself.
For the receipt.”</p>
<p>A lie. Baldric wouldn’t care if I gave it to a passing badger, so
long as the badger didn’t take a cut. But it was a plausible lie. The
guard scowled, but he jerked his head. “Make it quick. He’s in the
accounting room. Straight through, left at the passage. Don’t
wander.”</p>
<p>I walked into the yard, the sense of being a trespasser acute. Jarvis
emerged from a doorway as I approached, as if he had smelled my
presence. His face was a closed door.</p>
<p>“You,” he said. The word was flat, final.</p>
<p>“The rent, steward.” I extended the coin.</p>
<p>He did not take it immediately. His eyes crawled over my face,
looking for the variable, the disruption. “You were told not to
return.”</p>
<p>“A man must pay his rent. Even,” I said, meeting his gaze, “if he
must cross a bridge to do it.”</p>
<p>Something flickered in his eyes again. Not just anger. Calculation.
He understood the metaphor. He took the coin, his fingers brushing mine
with a deliberate coldness. “Wait here.” He disappeared inside and
returned a moment later with a scrap of paper. A receipt. He thrust it
at me. “Now go. And heed the warning. The next conversation we have will
be with a lash in my hand.”</p>
<p>I took the paper, dipped my head in a semblance of deference, and
turned. I did not look at the tower. I felt its presence at my back, a
magnetic pull. I walked out, feeling his eyes on me until the gate
clanged shut.</p>
<p>That night, I went to the cabinet. I took the lock-picks, the thin
knife, the coil of cord. I took the small silver mirror. I dressed in
the dark clothes. I became a shadow in my own room.</p>
<p>The woods were an old acquaintance now. I moved without thought, my
body finding the path. From my vantage in the trees, I watched the
midnight round. Jarvis completed his circuit, glared at the tower light,
and retired to the main house. The guards huddled by their brazier.</p>
<p>The moon was behind a cloud. The world was ink and charcoal.</p>
<p>I moved down the hill to the tower’s back, where the shadow was
deepest. The ivy was thick here, a net of ancient stems. I tested a
handful. It held. The first few feet were the hardest, a scramble to
find purchase. Then the pattern emerged: a foothold in the mortar, a
pull on a woody cable, a knee against a protruding stone. It was a
vertical puzzle, and my body solved it with a quiet, focused certainty
that felt like remembering.</p>
<p>I did not look down. I listened. The snores from the guard post. The
sigh of the wind. The scrape of my own progress, softer than a mouse in
the thatch.</p>
<p>Her window was still ten feet above me. The masonry changed here,
newer, smoother. The holds grew scarce. I paused, wedged in a corner,
and uncoiled the cord from my shoulder. I had fashioned a hook from an
old hinge. I swung it gently, once, twice, and let it fly upward. It
clinked softly against the iron grille of Eleanor’s window, caught, and
held.</p>
<p>I put my weight on it slowly. It held firm. The final climb was a
hand-over-hand pull, my boots scrabbling for any friction on the stone.
Then my hands were on the cold iron bars, my face level with the
window.</p>
<p>The room within was lit by a single candle. Eleanor sat in her chair,
the pot of earth in her lap. She was not looking at it. She was staring
at the window, her eyes wide, unblinking. She had heard the hook. She
was waiting.</p>
<p>Our eyes met through the bars.</p>
<p>For a moment, there was only shock. Then a profound, weary
understanding settled onto her features. She did not smile. She nodded,
once, as if acknowledging a grim, expected truth. She set the pot aside,
stood, and came to the window. Her fingers wrapped around the bars next
to mine.</p>
<p>“You came back,” she breathed, the words misting the cold iron.</p>
<p>“I promised,” I said. My voice was a dry rustle. “Can you open
it?”</p>
<p>“It is barred from the outside. A hasp on the left.” She pointed. I
leaned out, gripping the grille, and felt along the stone. My fingers
found a heavy, cold iron strap bolted into the wall, and a simple, thick
pin holding the grille shut. Not a lock. A physical barrier. The pin was
stiff with rust and age. I took the thin knife from my belt, worked the
blade into the joint, and levered. With a gritty shriek that sounded
deafening in the silence, the pin shifted. I pulled it free.</p>
<p>The grille swung outward a few inches, protesting on its hinges.</p>
<p>Eleanor’s hand shot through the gap and seized my wrist. Her grip was
astonishingly strong. “Quickly. Before the stone tells him.”</p>
<p>I squeezed through the opening, dropping into a crouch on the floor
inside. The room was warmer, smelling of beeswax, dried herbs, and the
faint, clean scent of her. I turned and pushed the grille shut, sliding
the pin back into place. It was a illusion of security, but
necessary.</p>
<p>When I turned back, she was studying me as if I were a rare text. She
took in the dark clothes, the cord coiled on my shoulder, the tools at
my belt. “You are not a farmer,” she said.</p>
<p>“I am,” I said. “But I am also… this.” I did not know what to call
it. The man from before. The man with the cabinet.</p>
<p>“You are a rememberer,” she said. She stepped closer, her eyes
searching my face in the candlelight. “You have remembered how to climb.
How to move in silence. What else have you remembered?”</p>
<p>“Nothing,” I admitted. “These are just… things I know how to do. Like
knowing how to breathe. The memory of <em>why</em> is not there.”</p>
<p>She accepted this with a slow nod. “The stones are like that. They
hold the memory of pressure, of weight, of weather. But not the memory
of the mason’s name.” She gestured to the floor. “Sit. You are a new
pressure in this room. The stones are whispering.”</p>
<p>I sat on the floor, my back against the wall beside the window. She
resumed her chair, pulling her shawl tight. The pot of earth was between
us.</p>
<p>“Jarvis knows,” I said. “He sees me as a threat.”</p>
<p>“He is the guardian of the silence,” she said. “My father’s shame is
a quiet, respectable one. A daughter with a delicate mind, cared for in
seclusion. It is a story the world accepts. A daughter who hears the
voices in the walls… that is a story that burns witches.” She looked at
the pot. “He does not know about this. This is my silence. My act of
remembering.”</p>
<p>“What does it remember?”</p>
<p>She was quiet for a long time. The candle guttered. “Hope,” she said,
finally. The word seemed to cost her. “Before my mother died, she had a
garden. She grew herbs, flowers… things of beauty and use. She said all
life began in the quiet dark of the earth. That waiting was a kind of
faith.” She touched the rim of the pot. “After they put me here, after
the world decided I was mad, I asked for this. Just a pot of earth.
Jarvis thought it was a pathetic, childish thing. He allowed it. He does
not understand that I am not waiting for something to grow. I am tending
the memory of the waiting itself. The memory of hope.”</p>
<p>I looked at the bare, dark soil. It was the most truthful thing I had
ever seen.</p>
<p>“We have to get you out,” I said.</p>
<p>Her laugh was a short, sharp sound, like ice cracking. “Out? To
where? I have no money. No friends. My name is a byword for madness. If
I run, Jarvis will have every right to hunt me. My father would sign the
warrant. It is cleaner this way.”</p>
<p>“Then we change the story,” I said. The idea formed as I spoke it,
solidifying from the dark water of the situation. “We do not prove you
are sane. We prove the silence is a lie.”</p>
<p>She stared at me. “How?”</p>
<p>“Your gift. You hear the memories in the stone. This manor is old.
What has it seen? What secrets does it hold that Jarvis, that my lord
father, would not want heard?” I leaned forward. “You said the stones
whisper of a woman’s tears in this room. What else do they whisper? In
the accounting room where Jarvis counts his silver? In my lord’s
chamber?”</p>
<p>A slow, dawning light ignited in her eyes. It was not hope. It was
sharper. It was purpose. “You want to weaponize my madness.”</p>
<p>“I want to arm the truth,” I said. “If we cannot break the prison, we
break the jailer’s reputation. A steward who covers for his lord’s
crimes is one thing. A steward who imprisons a truth-teller to hide his
own… that is a story even Sir Guy might not be able to silence.”</p>
<p>She stood and walked to the wall, placing her palm flat against the
cold stone. She closed her eyes. “The stones are tired,” she murmured.
“They have held so many secrets. They are heavy with them.” She opened
her eyes and looked at me. “Jarvis. He is not just a steward. He was my
father’s sergeant-at-arms. In the wars. They did… things. Together. The
stones in the old armory downstairs, they dream of blood that was not
honourably spilled. They whisper of a chest, buried under the
flagstones, that does not belong to my father.”</p>
<p>My breath caught. “You have heard this?”</p>
<p>“I have felt the shape of it. A guilty weight. I never cared to
listen closer. His guilt was his own.” She turned from the wall. “But if
it is a weapon…”</p>
<p>“It is a lever,” I said. “We need details. Names. Dates.”</p>
<p>“To listen that closely… it is like pressing your ear to a screaming
mouth. It is painful. It takes time.” She hugged herself. “And I cannot
go to the armory. I am not allowed to leave this floor.”</p>
<p>“Then I will bring the stones to you,” I said.</p>
<p>She blinked. “What?”</p>
<p>I looked around the room. My gaze fell on the fireplace. It was a
small, mean hearth, but the stones that framed it were old, reclaimed
from elsewhere in the manor. “Not these. They are too settled.” My eyes
travelled to the door. “The keystone. From the arch of the armory door,
or the cellar. A stone that has heard the traffic of guilty men. If I
can bring you a piece of the place, can you listen?”</p>
<p>She looked horrified, then fascinated. “A fragment… yes. The memory
would be fresh in its fracture. It would be… loud.” She met my eyes.
“Can you do such a thing?”</p>
<p>I thought of the tools in my belt, of the climb, of the lazy guards.
I thought of the cabinet in the basement, and the man who had built it
for a purpose he had not yet known. “Yes,” I said. The word had the same
finality as my promise.</p>
<p>A sound echoed up the stairwell. A door closing. Then a tread on the
steps. Heavy. Slow. Deliberate.</p>
<p>Jarvis.</p>
<p>Eleanor’s eyes flew wide. She pointed to the space behind the bed. I
moved, silent and swift, melting into the deep shadow as the footfalls
reached the landing.</p>
<p>The key turned in the lock. The door opened.</p>
<p>Jarvis stood in the doorway, a lantern in his hand. He did not enter
fully. He swept the room with his gaze: Eleanor, standing by the wall,
her pot, the chair, the empty window. His eyes were like two chips of
obsidian.</p>
<p>“You are awake,” he said. His voice was flat.</p>
<p>“I sleep poorly,” Eleanor said. Her voice had changed. It was
thinner, higher, with a faint, wavering edge. The voice of the
brain-fevered girl.</p>
<p>“I heard a sound,” Jarvis said. “A scraping.”</p>
<p>“The wind,” she said, turning to look at the window. “It worries the
grille. It sounds like someone trying to get in. Or out.”</p>
<p>He stared at her back, then let his lantern light drift over the
floor near the window. I held my breath. My boots had left no mark on
the boards. He took a step into the room, his boot heel landing where my
knee had been moments before.</p>
<p>“The rent was paid today,” he said, his eyes still on her. “By that
farmer. Emeric.”</p>
<p>Eleanor did not turn. “The quiet one.”</p>
<p>“He is not quiet. He is a hole where silence leaks out.” Jarvis took
another step, now fully inside. The door remained open behind him. “He
asked about you. He is curious. Curiosity in men like him is a dangerous
thing. It leads to notions. To trespass.”</p>
<p>“You told him not to return.”</p>
<p>“I did.” Jarvis was now between me and the door. I could see the back
of his neck, the tight set of his shoulders. “But men with notions are
like moths. They see the light, they feel the heat, and they beat
themselves to pieces against the glass.” He turned slowly, his lantern
casting long, swinging shadows. The light passed over the bed, over my
hiding place, and moved on. “If he comes near you again, if he tries to
feed you stories, you will tell me. Do you understand? Your father’s
reputation depends on your quiet. Your peace depends on it.”</p>
<p>“I understand, Jarvis.” Her mad-girl voice was perfectly
submissive.</p>
<p>He stood there for another minute, a monument to controlled
suspicion. Then, with a final, sweeping look, he turned and walked out.
The key turned again. The tread descended the stairs.</p>
<p>I waited until the sound had faded completely before I emerged.
Eleanor was leaning against the wall, her performance fallen away,
leaving her pale and drained.</p>
<p>“He knows,” she whispered. “Not that you are here. But that you are a
threat. He will be watching.”</p>
<p>“Then we must be the silence he doesn’t hear,” I said. I went to the
window, prepared to unlatch the grille.</p>
<p>“Emeric.” Her voice stopped me. She had not used my name before. It
sounded different in her mouth. Not a worn shoe. A key in a lock. “The
keystone. From the old armory. It is in the lowest part of the house,
beneath the kitchen. The door is oak, banded with iron. The keystone is
the centre of the arch.”</p>
<p>I nodded, committing it to memory. “I will bring it to you.”</p>
<p>“And if you are caught?”</p>
<p>“Then the story changes sooner than we planned,” I said.</p>
<p>A ghost of a smile touched her lips. “Then be a quiet moth.”</p>
<p>I slipped out the window, replaced the pin, and began the slower,
more careful descent. The world below was still asleep. But as my feet
touched the frozen ground, I looked up. Her light still burned. A small,
steady point in the vast dark.</p>
<p>I had come back. I had made a new promise. And I had a new thing to
remember: the feel of a keystone, the shape of a secret, the weight of a
truth that could topple a jailer.</p>
<p>The bridge was no longer just to her tower. It was into the very
foundations of the house that held her. I walked back through the
sleeping woods, the name <em>Eleanor</em> and the word <em>armory</em>
beating a quiet, twin rhythm in my mind, a new map being drawn over the
blank spaces of my past.</p>
<p>The first thing I remembered was my own name. Now, I would help the
stones remember theirs.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-15">Chapter 15</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-15-1"><strong>CHAPTER 15</strong></h2>
<p>The woods were not silent on the walk back. They were full of the
memory of sound. The crunch of my own footsteps on the frost seemed to
echo a previous set, from a time I could not place. The sigh of the wind
through bare branches was the ghost of a conversation, half-heard and
never understood. <em>Eleanor. Armory.</em> The words were not just
words; they were stones I carried, and with each step I placed them on a
path only I could see, leading back into the dark heart of a house that
had forgotten it was a prison.</p>
<p>I did not go to the cottage. Baldric’s disappointment was a room I
had no wish to inhabit. Instead, I went to the forge. It was cold, the
great anvil a block of shadow in the pre-dawn gloom. This was where I
had first felt the shape of a useful truth, with hammer and hot iron.
The memory was solid. I clung to it.</p>
<p>I sat on the stone step, my back against the cold door, and let the
twin rhythms in my mind settle. The keystone. The centre of the arch.
Beneath the kitchen, an oak door banded with iron. It was a specific
kind of forgetting, to hide a thing in the lowest part of a house. You
hoped the earth would swallow the knowledge. But stones remember
pressure. They remember their place in a pattern. To remove the keystone
was to ask the arch to forget how to stand.</p>
<p>The sky bled from black to the colour of a bruise. I stood, my joints
complaining like rusty hinges. I had a direction now. A task. It was
more than I’d had in months.</p>
<p>Baldric was at the table when I entered, chewing on a piece of hard
bread with the grim determination of a man punishing his food. He looked
at me, his potato-face set in its usual configuration of discontent.</p>
<p>“Out philosophizing again?” he grunted.</p>
<p>“Walking,” I said. It was not a lie. It was a fragment of the truth,
which was all I could afford him.</p>
<p>“Walking don’t fill the larder. Sir Guy’s man was here. Rent’s due
tomorrow, not Thursday. He’s decided.” Baldric’s eyes were on me,
watching for a flinch. “Says the master’s mood has turned. Says we’re to
be reminded of our obligations.”</p>
<p>A cold that had nothing to do with the morning settled in my gut.
Jarvis. Spreading his master’s unease like a damp. “We have the
silver.”</p>
<p>“We have <em>most</em> of the silver. You’ve been more interested in
playing blacksmith than farmer. The shortfall is your portion.” He said
it with a kind of grim satisfaction. This was a language he understood:
lack, blame, the simple arithmetic of failure.</p>
<p>I had forgotten about the rent. It was a mundane, brutal thread I had
not factored into my new, secret map. “I will get it.”</p>
<p>“How? Will you ask the turnips for a loan? Or perhaps your silent
friend in the woods has coin to spare?” His voice was sly, probing. The
village had eyes. My nocturnal absences were not invisible, just暂时
ignored.</p>
<p>“I will work at the forge. Today. I’ll take any commission.
Horseshoes, hinges, repairs.”</p>
<p>He snorted. “It’s not market day. No one’s bringing you work.”</p>
<p>“Then I’ll find the work that’s waiting.” I took my cloak from its
peg. The wool was coarse and smelled of smoke and old rain. A familiar
smell. An Emeric smell.</p>
<p>“You’re a dreamer,” Baldric said to my back. “Dreams don’t pay rent.
Actions do.”</p>
<p>He was right, though not in the way he meant. My actions were now
divided into two streams: one for the world of Baldric and Sir Guy and
silver coins, and one for the world of Eleanor and keystones and silent
moths. I had to tend to both, or the first would collapse and bury the
second before it could begin.</p>
<p>I walked to the village not as Emeric the forgetful turnip farmer,
but as Emeric the blacksmith who could sometimes remember how to make a
thing whole. I went to the tavern first. The door was shut, but smoke
whispered from the chimney. I knocked.</p>
<p>Gareth opened it, his broad face puffy with sleep. “God’s teeth, man.
The sun’s barely a rumour.”</p>
<p>“I need work,” I said. “Anything. Your hinge is loose on the top
right. I can fix it for a penny. And your fireback is cracked. I can
braze it.”</p>
<p>He squinted at me, as if trying to read small print on my soul. “A
penny for the hinge. Threepence for the fireback if you can do it
without pulling my whole hearth apart.”</p>
<p>“Done.”</p>
<p>I spent the morning in the tavern’s yard, with Gareth’s tools and a
small fire I built myself. The hinge was simple. The familiar heft of a
hammer, the focus required to heat and bend and shape, it quieted the
other rhythm in my head. This was a different kind of memory: the memory
of skill in my hands. It felt clean.</p>
<p>The fireback was harder. It was an old, cast piece, a crack spidering
across a moulded scene of a stag hunt. To fix it, I had to understand
its structure, its weaknesses. I cleaned the crack, ground it into a
channel, heated the piece slowly and evenly. I used brass as a filler,
watching it flow like liquid sunlight into the wound. It was not a
perfect mend. A scar would remain. But it would hold. It would remember
its purpose.</p>
<p>Gareth inspected it, running a thick finger over the braze line.
“Huh. Not pretty. But solid.” He paid me four pennies. “A bonus for
early-morning quiet.”</p>
<p>Next was the wheelwright, whose cart axle had snapped. He needed a
new one forged and fitted. It was a full day’s work, he said. I told him
I could do it by noon. He laughed, a dry, sceptical sound. I did not
laugh. I went to the forge, lit the great fire, and began.</p>
<p>The rhythm was everything. Pump the bellows. Heat the iron. See the
colour change from black to blood-red to the yellow-white of ripe
barley. Strike. Turn. Strike. The axle was not a thought; it was a
becoming. My world shrank to the heat on my face, the song of the
hammer, the slow emergence of shape from chaos. I forgot Eleanor. I
forgot the keystone. I forgot Sir Guy and the rent. There was only the
metal and the will to make it right.</p>
<p>The wheelwright returned as the church bell tolled midday. He saw the
finished axle, cooling on the bench, perfectly shaped, the ends already
upset for the fittings. His mouth opened, then closed. He paid me a full
day’s wage without a word.</p>
<p>I had six shillings in my pocket. My portion of the rent. It was a
solid weight. A truth Baldric could not dispute.</p>
<p>I walked back through the village, the sun a weak coin behind the
clouds. The physical exhaustion was a pleasant fog. It left room for
only one clear thought: the armory. It was a word with a shape. It
suggested long halls, empty stands, the ghost-smell of oil and fear. An
old armory beneath a kitchen. A repurposing. A forgetting.</p>
<p>As I passed the smithy, I saw a figure waiting. Lean, wrapped in a
clerk’s dark cloak, standing as still as a marking-stone. Jarvis.</p>
<p>He did not smile. His presence was a subtraction from the day.</p>
<p>“Emeric,” he said. My name in his mouth was not a key. It was a label
on a box.</p>
<p>“Jarvis.”</p>
<p>“Productive morning, I see.” His eyes flicked to the coal dust on my
hands, my tunic. “The forge is a noble trade. Honest. It makes tangible
things. One can trust a well-made hinge.”</p>
<p>“Can one?”</p>
<p>“It performs its function without subterfuge. It does not pretend to
be a window, or a lock. It is merely a hinge.” He took a step closer.
The smell of him was parchment and cold stone. “Sir Guy is pleased with
the new fittings for the guest rooms. He remarked on their quality. He
wonders, however, if the craftsman might have other talents. Latent
ones.”</p>
<p>I kept my face as still as the anvil. “A blacksmith makes what he is
asked to make.”</p>
<p>“Just so.” Jarvis’s gaze was a slow, searching pressure. “But
sometimes a man is asked to make one thing, and his mind wanders to the
making of another. A lock, for instance. Or a key. The mind is a
restless tool. It seeks patterns. It seeks… connections.”</p>
<p>The silence between us was a taut wire. He was not asking about the
rent. He was auditing my thoughts.</p>
<p>“My mind is on my work,” I said. “It leaves little room for
wandering.”</p>
<p>“A blessing, that.” He smiled then, a thin, paper-cut of a smile.
“Keep your mind on your work, Emeric. And your hands. Stray not into
drafts. They can extinguish even the most steady flame.”</p>
<p>He gave a slight, precise nod and walked away, his footsteps making
no sound on the dirt. The threat was not in the words, but in the spaces
between them. <em>He knows</em>, Eleanor had whispered. <em>Not that you
are here. But that you are a threat.</em></p>
<p>I had earned my silver. And I had drawn his eye closer. It was a
balance, precarious as a bird on a branch.</p>
<p>I gave Baldric the coins that evening. He counted them twice, his
surprise a sour thing. “Hmph. Maybe you’re not entirely a hole in a
bucket.”</p>
<p>“Maybe not,” I said, and took my bowl of stew to the doorstep to eat.
The night was clear, the cold sharp as a blade’s edge. The stars were
chips of ice in the black. Somewhere among them, or beneath them, was a
tower with a single, steady light.</p>
<p>The armory. It was a problem of architecture. To get beneath the
kitchen, I needed to be inside the manor. The thought was a closed door.
I had no reason to be there. No invitation. Jarvis’s warning was a lock
on that door.</p>
<p>I finished my stew, the grease congealing in the bowl. A plan, like a
piece of metal, had to be heated before it could be shaped. It required
the right fuel.</p>
<p>The next day, I went back to the forge. I worked on small things:
nails, hooks, a new hasp for the tavern’s stable door. But in the
intervals, when the iron was heating, I worked on another thing. A gift.
A reason.</p>
<p>I used a scrap of good steel, thin and flexible. I heated it, drew it
out, curled it with careful taps of the hammer. I quenched it, polished
it on a stone until it shone with a dull, grey gleam. It was not a tool.
It was not a weapon. It was a simple, elegant shape, like a leaf caught
in a breeze, or a flame frozen in time. It could be a bookmark. It could
be a hairpin. It was a piece of beauty with no clear purpose, the kind
of thing a practical man would never make.</p>
<p>When it was done, I wrapped it in a scrap of soft leather.</p>
<p>I waited until full dark. The moon was a paring of nail in the sky. I
took the path through the woods, my breath pluming in the air. The tower
was a darker shadow against the night. No light showed.</p>
<p>My climb was slower this time, my body stiff from the day’s labour.
Each grip was a calculation, each foothold a silent prayer. I was a
beetle on a wall, insignificant and exposed.</p>
<p>I reached the window. The grille was still pinned from the outside. I
pulled the pin, slid the grille open, and slipped inside.</p>
<p>The room was dark but for the embers in the hearth. She was a
silhouette in the chair by the fire, wrapped in a blanket. She did not
startle.</p>
<p>“I felt the stone flinch,” she said, her voice soft as the ash. “A
quiet moth returns.”</p>
<p>“The house is watched,” I said, moving closer. The room held her
scent: beeswax, old wool, a hint of rosemary. “Jarvis. He is…
auditing.”</p>
<p>“He audits everything. The air itself must account for its
movements.” She turned her head. The ember-glow lit the curve of her
cheek. “Did you bring the keystone?”</p>
<p>“Not yet. I brought you this.” I held out the leather parcel.</p>
<p>She was still for a moment. Then a pale hand emerged from the blanket
and took it. She unfolded the leather. The steel shape caught the faint
light. She did not speak. Her fingers traced the curves, the cool,
smooth surface.</p>
<p>“It is useless,” she said finally.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“It is beautiful.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>She held it to her breast. “A useless, beautiful thing. A secret of
its own.” She looked at me. “Why?”</p>
<p>“A blacksmith makes what he is asked to make,” I said, repeating my
words to Jarvis. “But sometimes his mind wanders.”</p>
<p>A real smile then, not a ghost. It transformed her face, made her
mad-girl mask seem like a crude caricature. “Thank you, Emeric.”</p>
<p>“I need a way into the house,” I said. “A reason to be beneath the
kitchen.”</p>
<p>The smile faded, replaced by a look of intense concentration. She
placed the steel shape carefully on the small table beside her. “The
kitchen is Mrs. Barlow’s kingdom. She is… a fortress. Suspicious of
drafts and strangers. But she has a weakness.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Vanity. And a great, black iron stove that smokes. It has smoked for
two years. It drives her to fury. Sir Guy will not spend to replace it.
The local smith—a man named Croft—has been to see it four times. He
pokes it, pronounces it ‘quirky,’ and leaves. It still smokes.”</p>
<p>I saw the shape of the plan now, emerging from the heat of the
problem. “And if a different smith were to hear of this legendary
stove…?”</p>
<p>“If he were to arrive, unasked, and offer a free assessment…
Mrs. Barlow might, in her desperation, let him into her kingdom. To the
very heart of it. The stove sits against the north wall. The floor near
it is stone. There is a trapdoor, for ash and cinders. It is how the
boys empty the pans. It leads to a brick ash-pit below. And from that
pit…” She leaned forward, her eyes holding mine. “There is a brick
archway, sealed long ago with rubble. Behind that rubble is the passage
to the old armory. The oak door is on the far side.”</p>
<p>The map in my mind completed itself. Not down through the house, but
up through its bowels. Through the domain of a vain, frustrated cook and
her faulty altar.</p>
<p>“It is a risk,” I said. “If Jarvis sees me…”</p>
<p>“He rarely enters the kitchen. He considers it beneath him. And
Mrs. Barlow’s temper is a shield. She tolerates no interference.”
Eleanor’s hand found mine in the dark. Her fingers were cold. “You must
be confident. You must be the man who knows stoves. Not the man who
knows secrets.”</p>
<p>“I am a man who forgets,” I said. “But I am learning to remember
trades.”</p>
<p>“Then remember this one.” She squeezed my hand and let go. “Go now.
Come back tomorrow, in the light. Be bold. Be useful.”</p>
<p>I left her then, the useless, beautiful thing gleaming on her table.
The descent was easier. I had a new shape in my mind: a stove, a
trapdoor, an arch of brick. A back door into memory.</p>
<p>The next morning, I put on my least-mended tunic, the one that
smelled most strongly of smoke and honest labour. I went to the manor
not through the woods, but up the main track, like a tradesman.</p>
<p>The kitchen door was at the side of the house, down a short flight of
steps into a sunken yard. Steam and the smell of baking bread clouded
the air. I knocked, the sound firm and businesslike.</p>
<p>It was opened by a girl of about fourteen, flour dusting her arms
like a second skin. Her eyes went wide.</p>
<p>“I’m here for the stove,” I said, my voice carrying past her into the
steam. “Heard it’s been holding a grudge against the cook.”</p>
<p>A voice, like granite rolling, came from within. “Who’s that? If it’s
Croft come to poke it again, tell him he can poke his own—“</p>
<p>A woman appeared, wiping her hands on a vast apron. She was built on
a monumental scale, with a face that had weathered a thousand culinary
storms. This was Mrs. Barlow. Her eyes, small and bright as currants,
fixed on me.</p>
<p>“You’re not Croft.”</p>
<p>“Emeric. The smith from the village.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t send for you.”</p>
<p>“No,” I agreed. “But a stove that smokes for two years is a personal
insult to any craftsman. I was in the area. Thought I’d take a look. No
charge for the looking.”</p>
<p>She crossed her arms, which were like seasoned hams. Suspicion and a
desperate hope warred in her expression. The hope won. “Two years,” she
said, the words a lament. “It blackens my sauces. It stings my eyes.
Croft is a fool.”</p>
<p>“Then let a different fool have a try.”</p>
<p>A grudging respect flickered in her currant eyes. She stepped back.
“Five minutes. I’ve a pie coming out.”</p>
<p>The kitchen was a cavern of heat and industry. A great table
dominated the centre, scarred and floury. Pots simmered. The offending
stove squatted against the far wall, a hulking beast of black iron and
nickel trim. A faint, sinister wisp of grey seeped from its top
plate.</p>
<p>I approached it with the reverence of a priest approaching a
difficult relic. I ignored the kitchen maids who paused to watch. I
ignored everything but the metal. I ran a hand along its flank. Cold. I
examined the flue collar, the damper. I got down on my knees and looked
at the firebox door, the ash pit door beneath it.</p>
<p>“Do you always light it with the bottom door ajar?” I asked, without
looking up.</p>
<p>Mrs. Barlow, now extracting a golden-crusted pie from the oven, went
still. “A finger’s width. For draft.”</p>
<p>“It’s a backdraft,” I said. “It’s pulling cold air up through the
ash, choking the fire, forcing the smoke out anywhere it can.” I tapped
the ash pit door. It was a simple, heavy thing of iron. “The seal is
gone. Warped by heat. It needs remaking. And your flue pipe has a crush
in it, three feet up. I can hear the grief in it.”</p>
<p>I stood up, meeting her gaze. “I can make a new door that fits. I can
straighten the flue. It will take me most of the day. I’ll need to work
down here, and in the ash pit below to see the full damage.”</p>
<p>Her pie was on the table, steaming. She looked from it to the stove,
to me. The battle was brief. The stove had tortured her for too long.
“Do it,” she said. “But if you make it worse, I’ll bake you in it.”</p>
<p>It was permission. I fetched my tools from the forge, a journey made
under the blank windows of the manor’s main house. I felt watched, but I
kept my gait that of a preoccupied workman.</p>
<p>Back in the kitchen, I became part of the scenery. I took
measurements. I made sketches on a scrap of wood. I removed the old,
warped ash door. Then, with Mrs. Barlow’s grudging nod, I lifted the
heavy iron trapdoor set into the stone floor beside the stove.</p>
<p>A smell of cold cinders and damp rose from the darkness. A wooden
ladder led down.</p>
<p>“Mind the rats,” one of the kitchen girls whispered, half in jest,
half in fear.</p>
<p>I took a lantern, lit it, and descended.</p>
<p>The ash pit was a brick-lined cube, about eight feet to a side. It
was filled with a soft, grey mound of old ash. The base of the stove’s
flue descended into one wall. And there, on the opposite wall, just as
Eleanor had said, was a brick archway. It was indeed sealed with rough
rubble and mortar, but it was an arch. The keystone would be at its
centre, on the other side.</p>
<p>My heart beat a thick, slow drum against my ribs. I was here. I set
the lantern on a brick ledge and forced myself to turn away. First, the
work. The pretense.</p>
<p>I spent an hour inspecting the flue from below, tapping bricks,
noting the crush. I measured the opening for the new door. I made noise.
I was the picture of industry.</p>
<p>Only when I heard the clatter of pans and the rise of voices from
above—the midday chaos—did I allow myself to approach the sealed
arch.</p>
<p>The mortar was old, but it was not fortress-quality. It was a hasty
job, the rubble not interlocked, just thrown into the opening and
plastered over. The keystone was the key. If I could remove it, the arch
might forget how to stand. But I could not remove it from here.</p>
<p>I needed to be on the other side.</p>
<p>I placed my hands on the cold rubble. I closed my eyes. I tried to
feel the memory in the stones. The armory. The chill of weapons, the
echo of boots. The silence after it was abandoned, sealed, forgotten.
And the keystone, the centre of it all, holding the memory of that empty
space in its very shape.</p>
<p>A voice from above, sharp with impatience, shattered the silence.
“Smith! You found the problem or are you taking a nap down there?”</p>
<p>I withdrew my hands. “Coming!” I called back, my voice echoing in the
pit.</p>
<p>I climbed the ladder, blinking in the kitchen’s light. “The flue is
worse than I thought,” I said to Mrs. Barlow. “I’ll need to rebuild a
section from below. It will be noisy. And dusty.”</p>
<p>She grimaced. “Can’t be helped. Do what you must. Just have it
drawing by supper, or you’ll answer to me.”</p>
<p>I spent the afternoon in a pantomime of repair. I hauled bricks and
mortar down the ladder. I made careful, deliberate noise with my chisel
and hammer on the old flue bricks, creating the necessary dust. But my
mind was on the arch. The oak door banded with iron. The keystone.</p>
<p>As the light began to fail, I installed the new ash door I’d forged
at my own fire. It fit perfectly, with a satisfying, airtight
<em>thud</em>. I climbed out, filthy and sweating.</p>
<p>“Light it,” I said.</p>
<p>Mrs. Barlow, with the air of a general approaching a treacherous
ally, lit the kindling in the stove’s belly. She closed the firebox
door. We waited.</p>
<p>The fire caught, crackled, grew. The smoke rose… and vanished up the
flue. Not a wisp escaped. The stove began to radiate a clean, fierce
heat.</p>
<p>Mrs. Barlow stared at it. Her face underwent a remarkable
transformation. The granite softened. The currant eyes gleamed with
something like joy. “Well,” she said, and her voice was almost gentle.
“Well, I’ll be.”</p>
<p>She insisted I take a meat pie and a mug of small beer before I left.
I ate at her table, a conquering hero in soot. As I finished, the
kitchen door opened.</p>
<p>Jarvis stood there, a ledger under his arm. His gaze swept the room,
passed over the maids, over Mrs. Barlow’s beaming face, and settled on
me. It was a long, cool look. He saw the soot, the tools, the empty
mug.</p>
<p>“A social call, Emeric?”</p>
<p>“A repair,” Mrs. Barlow boomed, before I could speak. “This man has
fixed in a day what that idiot Croft couldn’t in two years. My stove
breathes!”</p>
<p>“How fortunate,” Jarvis said, his eyes still on me. “And what was the
nature of the repair?”</p>
<p>“A warped door. A crushed flue,” I said, meeting his gaze. “Simple
things. They just needed the right attention.”</p>
<p>“Simple things often do,” he replied. “But it is good to see a man
focused on his trade. The world needs more reliable hinges, and fewer…
wandering drafts.”</p>
<p>He gave a slight nod and left, the door closing softly behind
him.</p>
<p>The triumph in the kitchen turned cold in my mouth. He had seen. He
had noted. My access was now a recorded fact in his ledger.</p>
<p>I gathered my tools, accepted Mrs. Barlow’s gruff thanks and a few
extra coins, and left.</p>
<p>The walk home was through gathering dusk. I had been inside. I had
seen the arch. I had a path. But Jarvis had drawn a line around me in
his mind. The space in which I could move was shrinking.</p>
<p>That night, in the cottage, Baldric was almost civil. The rent was
paid. The stove of the great house was fixed. For a moment, I was not a
hole in a bucket. I was a man with a skill.</p>
<p>But as I lay on my pallet, staring at the thatch, I saw not the
stove, but the rubble-filled arch. I felt not the satisfaction of a job
done, but the cold pressure of Jarvis’s gaze. I had my way in. But I was
now a marked piece on his board.</p>
<p>The first thing I remembered was my own name. Now, I had to remember
how to be a shadow in a house that was learning to watch. The keystone
was within reach. But to take it, I would have to become the silence
even Jarvis could not hear, moving through the foundations of a past
that was waiting, stone by stone, to be remembered. And the next step
would require not just a smith’s hands, but a thief’s nerve, in the
dark, dusty belly of the house, with the weight of the entire structure
above me, held in place by the one stone I was meant to steal.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-16">Chapter 16</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-16-1"><strong>CHAPTER 16</strong></h2>
<p>The second thing I forgot was how to be still. It was not the
stillness of a stone or a stump. It was the stillness of a man who is
not waiting. My stillness had become a kind of waiting, a coiled,
listening pause. I lay on my pallet and felt the cottage breathe around
me—Baldric’s wet snore from the loft, the scuttle of something in the
thatch, the slow exhalation of cooling embers in the hearth. My own
breath felt like a trespass.</p>
<p>Jarvis had drawn his line. I was a marked piece. The knowledge was a
cold pebble under my tongue, smooth and inarguable. To move now was to
confirm his suspicion. Not to move was to let the keystone settle deeper
into its bed of mortar and forgotten earth.</p>
<p>I rose before the false dawn. The air in the cottage was thick with
slept-in smells. I took my cloak and went out into the yard. The turnip
field was a grey smudge. The sky was the colour of a bruise not yet
decided on its hue. I stood there, hands empty, and tried to remember
how to be a thing that belonged to the landscape. A post. A furrow.
Something that did not think of arches or stewards or the precise, dry
sound a ledger makes when it is closed.</p>
<p>It did not work. I was Emeric, who remembered his name. I was the man
who had fixed the stove. I was the piece on the board. The memory was
not a flood but a seepage, a dampness rising through the floorboards of
my mind. I saw the arch, the rubble, the promising darkness behind it. I
felt the weight of the house above, a held breath. The keystone was a
tooth in a locked jaw. My job was to be the decay that loosened it.</p>
<p>Baldric emerged, blinking, into the yard. He saw me standing there
and his face performed its usual crumple of disdain. “Mooning about
again,” he said, the words garbled by sleep and missing teeth. “The
rent’s paid, but the field won’t till itself. Or have you forgotten the
turnips in favour of higher philosophical pursuits?”</p>
<p>“No,” I said. The word was a stone I dropped between us.</p>
<p>He grunted, shouldered past me to the lean-to for his tools. The
familiarity of the ritual was a worn groove. We worked in a silence that
was not companionable, but territorial. His spade bit the earth with
resentment. Mine with a borrowed purpose. Each clod I turned was a
rehearsal. This motion, this leverage, this transfer of weight—it was
not so different from working a pry-bar into a seam of stone.</p>
<p>The grey light hardened into day. My hands blistered, healed,
blistered again beneath the calluses. The body kept its own records. By
mid-morning, the pebble of knowledge under my tongue had dissolved into
a plan. It was not a good plan. It was a plan built of absence: the
absence of light, of witness, of better options.</p>
<p>I needed to learn the house’s night breath. I needed to know when it
slept.</p>
<p>“I’m for the village,” I said, leaning on my spade. “The drawplate
for the scythe blade is cracked. Need to see Hodges the smith.”</p>
<p>Baldric wiped his forehead with a filthy sleeve. “Silver for a new
one?”</p>
<p>“Mending. Trade.”</p>
<p>He eyed me, his potato-face sceptical. “Trade what? Your captivating
conversation?”</p>
<p>“My labour. An afternoon at his bellows for the mend.”</p>
<p>A shrug. A dismissal. I was a hole in a bucket, but sometimes a hole
could be useful for draining away a problem. “Don’t linger. The west
field needs attention.”</p>
<p>The walk to the village was a space to think. Hodges was a bear of a
man with a perpetual squint and forearms like knotted yew. He did not
ask questions. He saw the cracked drawplate, saw my arms, and grunted.
“Bellows. Two hours. Mind you keep it even. No gusting.”</p>
<p>The forge was a pocket of contained fury. The heat was a physical
presence, a shoving against the skin. The roar of the fire, the rhythmic
<em>whoosh-thump</em> of the bellows, the hammer’s song on the anvil—it
was a symphony of making. For two hours, I was not a man with a stolen
memory. I was a lung for the fire. I was a function. The simplicity was
a clean, hot blade. It cut through the tangled knot of my thoughts.</p>
<p>Hodges inspected the repaired drawplate, nodded once. “You’ve a feel
for it,” he said, as if accusing me of a minor crime. “Ever think of
proper smithing?”</p>
<p>“I have a feel for many things,” I said. “They are not all
trades.”</p>
<p>He snorted, but it was not unfriendly. “Aye. Well. The world runs on
hinges and blades. The rest is decoration.”</p>
<p>I left the village as the afternoon began to bleed into evening. But
I did not take the road home. I circled wide, through the copse of
skeletal alders, and came up behind the rise that overlooked Sir Guy’s
house. The great stone pile sat in its hollow, smoke rising from three
chimneys. The west wing, where the kitchen lay, where the arch was
buried, showed only narrow, slitted windows. They were like eyes
squeezed shut against the light.</p>
<p>I found a vantage behind a fallen oak, its trunk furred with moss. I
settled in. This was a different stillness. The hunter’s stillness. I
let my eyes lose their focus, taking in the whole scene. Movement was
what mattered.</p>
<p>I saw a scullery maid empty a basin into the kitchen garden. I saw a
stable boy lead a pair of horses to water. The rhythms were mundane,
slow. As dusk gathered, lamps were lit in the main hall. Shadows moved
against the yellow squares of the taller windows. One shadow, tall and
thin, paused at a window that I guessed overlooked the rear courtyard.
Jarvis. He stood for a long time, looking out. He was not seeing the
courtyard. He was reviewing the ledger in his mind. Checking the
entries.</p>
<p>He turned away. The lamp moved deeper into the house.</p>
<p>The true dark came, a seep of ink from the woods. The house became a
darker mass against the night, pricked by a few lingering points of
light. One by one, they winked out. The kitchen wing was the first to go
dark. Then the upper floors of the main house. A single light remained,
burning in a ground-floor room near the front—the steward’s office,
perhaps. It burned for an hour more. Then it, too, was extinguished.</p>
<p>The house slept. Or pretended to.</p>
<p>I counted. I listened to the sounds of the night—the owl, the rustle
in the undergrowth, the wind fingering the bare branches. I waited for
the change of the guard, for the night watchman’s round. But Sir Guy was
a minor lordling, his wealth more in land than in portable treasure.
There was no regular watch. Only Jarvis’s meticulous order, which
presumably locked doors and trusted to stone.</p>
<p>When the moon was a shard of bone above the trees, I moved. I did not
go down to the house. That would be for another night. Tonight, I needed
to know the land. I moved from shadow to shadow, a patch of deeper dark
in the darkness, circling the perimeter. I found the postern gate in the
outer wall, near the kitchen midden. It was iron-banded oak, locked. But
the wall itself was old, the mortar crumbling in places. I found a
foothold, a handhold. The climb was short, inelegant. I dropped into the
kitchen garden, the smell of turned earth and frost-shrivelled herbs
sharp in my nose.</p>
<p>I was inside the curtain. The back of the house loomed. The kitchen
door was solid, but to its left was the pantry, with a high, small
window shuttered with wood. I tested the shutter. It gave a little.
Warped wood, a rusted latch on the inside. A point of entry, but a noisy
one.</p>
<p>I retreated to the shadow of the garden wall. I stood for another
hour, letting the night settle into my bones. I saw no movement. No
candle flared behind a shutter. The house held its breath.</p>
<p>It was enough. I had the rhythm. The house slept a deep,
administrative sleep. Its vigilance was diurnal, a thing of ledgers and
observed propriety. The night was mine, provided I was quieter than the
settling stones.</p>
<p>I climbed back over the wall and melted into the woods.</p>
<p>Baldric was asleep when I returned. The cottage was a tomb of quiet.
I did not light a candle. I sat on my pallet, the cold of the night
still on my skin, and mapped the darkness I had just walked through. The
path from wall to pantry window. The likely route through the servant’s
corridors to the walled-off section. The arch. The silence I would have
to wear, a second skin.</p>
<p>The plan was still a thing of absence. But now the absences had
shapes. They had dimensions.</p>
<p>Three days passed. They were days of turnips and silence. Baldric’s
civility, such as it was, evaporated like morning dew under the sun of
his perpetual dissatisfaction. The rent was paid, so I was again a
luxury he could ill afford. I worked the fields and tended to the few
tools, my mind in the night, my hands moving by rote.</p>
<p>On the fourth day, a boy came from the house. He was maybe ten, with
ears that stuck out like jug handles and a smudge of soot on his nose.
He stood at the edge of the field, shifting from foot to foot.</p>
<p>“You the smith?” he called.</p>
<p>Baldric looked up, scowling. “He’s a turnip philosopher. What do you
want?”</p>
<p>The boy ignored him, eyes on me. “Mrs. Barlow says to come. The
stove’s damper is sticking. Says you’ll know it.”</p>
<p>I drove my spade into the earth. The summons was not unexpected. The
stove was a living thing, and like all living things, it had ailments.
But the timing felt like a line in Jarvis’s ledger. An entry.</p>
<p>“I’ll get my tools,” I said.</p>
<p>Baldric spat. “Another social call? Shall I prepare the guest
room?”</p>
<p>I walked past him, to the cottage. The boy trailed me. “She’s in a
right state,” he confided, his voice a conspiratorial whisper. “Says the
joint’s not roasting even. Says it’s all your doing.”</p>
<p>“It is,” I said. I gathered the leather roll of tools. The weight of
it was a comfort. A purpose.</p>
<p>The kitchen was a storm of heat and frustration. Mrs. Barlow stood
like a besieged general before the great iron stove, her face flushed.
“There!” she boomed, pointing a wooden spoon at the offending damper.
“It sticks fast when it’s hot. Lets all the good heat out the flue, then
slams shut and smothers the fire. It’s a devil!”</p>
<p>I approached. The stove was breathing, as she’d said, but it was an
asthmatic’s breath—wheezy and irregular. I could feel Jarvis’s absence
in the room. He was a man who scheduled repairs. My unscheduled return
was a ripple in his order. He would know of it.</p>
<p>“Let it cool a little,” I said. “I need to see the mechanism when
it’s free.”</p>
<p>“Cool? I’ve a dinner for fourteen to prepare! Sir Guy has guests from
the Abbey!”</p>
<p>“Then it will stick,” I said, my voice flat. “Or I can try to free it
now and risk breaking the pin.”</p>
<p>She glared at me, but the logic was unassailable. With a curse, she
turned to her underlings and began barking orders for alternative
arrangements—the hearth in the hall would have to be used for the
roasts. The kitchen descended into a new level of frantic chaos.</p>
<p>It was the cover I needed. As they rushed about, I bent to my work. I
examined the damper lever, felt the resistance. It was a simple pivot, a
pin through the cast iron. Expansion from the heat was binding it. A
little filing, a little grease. But I worked slowly, methodically, my
ears straining beyond the kitchen’s clamour.</p>
<p>I heard his footsteps in the corridor outside before I saw him. A
measured, dry tread. The kitchen noise dipped a fraction. Jarvis
appeared in the doorway, a parchment scroll in one hand. He surveyed the
scene, his gaze a soft broom sweeping crumbs from a table. It passed
over the scullions, over Mrs. Barlow’s red face, and came to rest on me,
crouched by the stove.</p>
<p>“A recurrence, Mrs. Barlow?” he asked, his voice mild.</p>
<p>“The damper, Mr. Jarvis. The man’s seeing to it.”</p>
<p>“How fortunate he was available.” Jarvis’s eyes were on my hands. “I
trust the repair will be more… permanent this time.”</p>
<p>“It is the nature of iron and fire, sir,” I said, not looking up.
“They are in a constant argument. My job is to be the occasional
treaty.”</p>
<p>A faint, dry smile touched his lips. It was not a pleasant thing. “A
poetic turn for a smith. See that your treaty holds. Sir Guy’s guests
are particular. They appreciate reliability.”</p>
<p>He lingered a moment longer, watching me scrape at the pin with a
fine file. Then he turned and left, his footsteps fading down the stone
corridor.</p>
<p>The pressure of his gaze lingered like a thumbprint on cooled wax. He
was not just checking the entry. He was underlining it.</p>
<p>I finished the filing, applied a dab of tallow from a pot on the
shelf. The damper lever moved freely, with a smooth, oily sigh. “It will
do,” I said. “But it will bind again in time. The casting is rough.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Barlow gave a grudging nod. “Time is all I need tonight. Here.”
She shoved a warm, linen-wrapped parcel into my hands. “Meat pies. For
your trouble.”</p>
<p>It was a dismissal, but a paid one. I took the parcel and my tools.
As I passed through the scullery, I glanced down the corridor that led
to the servants’ stairs, to the closed-off wing. It was dark, quiet. A
yawn in the belly of the house.</p>
<p>The walk home was slow. The meat pies were heavy in my hand. The
encounter with Jarvis was a confirmation. I was a watched man. My access
was granted, but it was circumscribed. He would allow me to mend the
stove, but he would note every visit. The night plan, the thief’s
nerve—it was not just an option now. It was the only path left. I had to
move before his ledger filled with enough entries to warrant a more
permanent solution—a dismissal, a suggestion to Sir Guy that the
turnip-farmer’s brother-in-law was a nuisance, a risk.</p>
<p>That night, I did not wait for Baldric to sleep. I feigned sleep on
my pallet, listening to his noises above. When his snore settled into a
sawing rhythm, I rose. I had prepared a bundle: dark clothes, a length
of rope, the small, sharp tools from my roll, a hooded lantern with the
shutter tight. I left the meat pies on the table. An alibi of sorts, if
one were needed.</p>
<p>The night was colder, the moon a sliver less. I was a ghost along the
hedgerows. My heart was a steady, dull drum in my chest. Not fear, but a
focused intensity. The stillness was gone. I was all motion now, intent
given legs.</p>
<p>I reached the wall. The climb was easier this time, my hands and feet
finding their holds without thought. I dropped into the kitchen garden.
The house was a black cliff. No lights. The pantry window shutter
yielded to my pry-bar with a groan that sounded like thunder in the
silent yard. I froze, pressed against the cold stone. Nothing
stirred.</p>
<p>I reached in, felt for the latch, lifted it. The shutter swung
inward. The window was small, but I was not a large man. I wriggled
through, dropping onto a stone floor littered with sacks of grain. The
air was close, smelling of dust and dried peas.</p>
<p>I stood in the absolute dark. I listened. The house had a sound, a
deep, tonal silence, like a bell after it has been struck. I could hear
the tick of cooling stone, the infinitesimal settle of timber. I opened
the lantern shutter a crack. A thin blade of light cut the darkness. I
was in the pantry. The door to the kitchen was ahead.</p>
<p>I moved. The kitchen was a cavern of looming shapes, the stove a
sleeping beast. I found the door to the servants’ passage. It was
unlocked. The passage was narrow, low-ceilinged. My light revealed
flagstones worn smooth by generations of hurrying feet. I followed it,
past closed doors to stillrooms, laundries, cellars.</p>
<p>Then I saw it. The archway. It was just as I remembered, yet
different in the stark, lonely beam of my lantern. The rubble filling it
was not a neat wall, but a tumble, as if the passage had simply vomited
stone until it could hold no more. The stones were smaller than I
recalled, coated in a fine, grey dust. On the other side, absolute
blackness.</p>
<p>This was the moment. The thief’s nerve. I set the lantern down,
shutter open just enough to see by. I began to work. Not with a spade’s
violence, but with a surgeon’s care. I took the stones from the top, one
by one. They were cold, gritty. Some were loose; others were wedged. I
worked quietly, placing each removed stone carefully against the passage
wall, building a new, neat pile. The dust filled my nose, my throat. I
worked for an hour. Two. The hole grew. A crawl space, then a gap I
could squeeze through if I turned my shoulders.</p>
<p>My world shrank to the circle of lantern light, to the next stone, to
the growing void. I forgot Jarvis, forgot Baldric, forgot the turnip
field. I was the silence moving through the foundations. I was the
decay.</p>
<p>Finally, the gap was wide enough. I took the lantern, shuttered it
almost completely, and squeezed through.</p>
<p>The air on the other side was different. Colder. Staler. It tasted of
old earth and slow time. I opened the lantern shutter.</p>
<p>I was in a corridor. It stretched away into darkness in both
directions. The walls were bare stone, older, rougher than the finished
masonry of the main house. This was the original structure, the bones. I
turned left, the direction I felt, in some deep, placeless memory, was
correct.</p>
<p>The corridor ended in a heavy, iron-strapped door. It was locked, but
the lock was ancient, a crude iron mechanism. My picks found the wards
easily. The door swung inward with a groan that seemed to shake dust
from the very air.</p>
<p>The room beyond was not large. It was circular, a tower base. And in
the centre, on a simple stone plinth, sat a chest. It was iron-bound
oak, black with age. This was not the keystone. This was something else.
A memory that had a shape, a weight.</p>
<p>I approached. The chest was not locked. The lid lifted without a
sound.</p>
<p>Inside, folded with a care that spoke of reverence, was a cloak. Not
a peasant’s rough wool, but a fine, heavy weave, dyed a deep,
undefinable colour that was neither blue nor grey nor green, but the
colour of twilight on a winter sea. Upon it lay a circlet of silver,
simple, unadorned. And beneath them, a book, its leather cover tooled
with strange, interlocking knots.</p>
<p>I did not touch them. I stared. These were not mine. They could not
be mine. I was Emeric, the turnip-farmer, the smith. I had dirty hands
and a rented cottage and a brother-in-law with a face like a
disappointed potato.</p>
<p>But my breath caught. A pain, sharp and sudden, lanced behind my
eyes. Not a memory, but the ghost of one—the feeling of cool silver on
my brow, the weight of that cloak on my shoulders, the scent of vellum
and candle-smoke.</p>
<p>A sound.</p>
<p>Distant. A footfall on stone. Not in my corridor, but somewhere
above. In the inhabited house.</p>
<p>I shut the lid. The sound was soft, final. I backed out of the room,
closed the door, heard the lock click home. I moved back down the
corridor, fast now, my heart hammering against my ribs. I squeezed back
through the hole in the archway. I had to close it up. I had to hide my
trespass.</p>
<p>I worked in a frantic, silent panic, replacing the stones, trying to
mimic the haphazard tumble. The dust swirled in the lantern light. My
hands were bleeding from sharp edges. I got the last stone in place just
as a new sound filtered down—the faint, far-off call of a cock,
heralding the false dawn.</p>
<p>I was out of time. I retreated, through the pantry window, pulling
the shutter closed behind me, leaving the latch unhooked. I crossed the
garden, scaled the wall, and ran, a shadow fleeing the coming light.</p>
<p>I reached the copse as the sky began to pale. I hid my bundle in a
hollow tree. I walked, slowly now, calmly, back to the cottage, as if I
had been out for an early walk. The first birds were beginning their
tentative songs.</p>
<p>Baldric was stirring when I entered. He looked at me, at my
dust-powdered clothes, my dirty, bloody hands.</p>
<p>“Up with the worms, are we?” he grumbled.</p>
<p>“Couldn’t sleep,” I said, my voice rough with dust and
exhaustion.</p>
<p>He shrugged, turned to stoke the fire. I went to the water barrel and
washed my hands. The water turned grey, then pink. I had my way in. I
had seen the arch, the corridor, the room. I had not found the
keystone.</p>
<p>But I had found a chest. And the things inside it were not tools, or
treasure. They were questions with weight and texture. They were a cloak
that felt like a season I had known, a circlet that fit a memory I did
not have.</p>
<p>The first thing I remembered was my own name. Now, I had to remember
why that name had once worn silver, and what a man who wore such things
was doing buried in a turnip field, with a head full of stones and a
past that waited, not in an arch, but in a locked room, under a cloak
the colour of a forgotten sky. Jarvis watched the stove. But he did not
know about the tower room. He did not know about the chest. My path was
no longer just to a stone. It was to a self I had mislaid. And that
self, I sensed with a cold certainty, was the key to everything—the
keystone, the house, the reason for the silence that pressed down on me,
heavier than all the masonry above. The next step would not be in the
dark. It would be into the light of a past that was mine, and yet as
foreign as the face of a stranger in a dusty glass.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-17">Chapter 17</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-17-1"><strong>CHAPTER 17</strong></h2>
<p>The second thing I forgot was how to be still. My hands, washed clean
of the tower’s dust and my own blood, would not stop their small,
restless movements. They plucked at the frayed wool of my tunic, traced
the grain of the rough-hewn table, turned a cold turnip over and over as
if reading its lumpen shape for prophecy. Baldric’s porridge sat like
mortar in my gut. The cottage, which had been a suffocating container
for years, now felt like a stage set, its walls thin and painted, its
truths as flimsy as the curtain across the sleeping alcove.</p>
<p>Baldric watched me with the dull, practical suspicion of a man
assessing a lame ox. “You’re twitchier than a hanged man’s leg,” he
observed, spooning his own breakfast. “That midnight stroll didn’t
settle your humours, then.”</p>
<p>“It clarified them,” I said. The words were true in a way he could
not fathom. My humours were no longer the vague melancholies of a
forgotten man; they were specific, sharp-edged things. The cold weight
of the silver circlet on my brow. The whisper of the cloak against my
fingers. The geometric chill of the tiles beneath my knees. These were
not phantoms. They were artefacts. They were mine.</p>
<p>He grunted, a sound that dismissed all interior weather as
self-indulgence. “Clarity don’t fill Sir Guy’s purse. The east field
wants turning before the rain comes. If your humours have so much
energy, you can put it into the spade.”</p>
<p>The east field. The turnips. The rent. The crushing, circular logic
of survival that had been my whole world. It was a story written in mud,
and I had been reciting my lines without thought. Now, the script was in
my hands, and it was written in a different ink. I saw the machinery of
it—the way Baldric’s anxiety was a goad, Sir Guy’s rent a leash, my own
lostness a convenient yoke. I had accepted it because I had no other
text. Now I had a page. A single, stolen page from a book I needed to
read in full.</p>
<p>I went to the east field. I drove the spade into the earth. But the
action was no longer mechanical. It was a disguise. With each lift and
turn of the soil, I was not farming. I was rehearsing. The weight of the
spade was the weight of the iron bar I had left in the copse. The
resistance of the clay was the resistance of the tower’s secrets. I
worked with a focused, furious calm, my body performing its familiar
labour while my mind walked the corridor under Jarvis’s house, knelt
before the chest, held the circlet to the light.</p>
<p>The past was not a country to be visited. It was a skin to be put on.
And it itched.</p>
<p>By midday, the sky was the colour of a bruise, yellow and purple at
the edges. The promised rain hung in the air, a damp press against the
skin. Baldric called a halt, his own mood soured by the brewing weather
and my uncharacteristic silence. We trudged back to the cottage. He
muttered about checking the eel traps in the stream. It was a flimsy
excuse; the stream was high and muddy, the traps would be empty. He
wanted away from the peculiar atmosphere I carried with me, a scent he
could not name but instinctively distrusted.</p>
<p>The moment the door shut behind him, the stillness in the cottage
changed. It was no longer an absence of sound, but a listening quiet. I
stood in the centre of the single room, the packed-earth floor, the
smoking hearth, the pallet of straw that was my bed. It was the cell of
a man named Emeric. A man who harvested turnips and feared his
brother-in-law and forgot things. It was a convincing portrait. But the
frame was wrong.</p>
<p>I went to the water barrel. Not to drink, but to look. My own face
stared back from the dark, disturbed surface. A face I knew and did not
know. It was older than I felt, lined with weather and worry, the beard
rough, the hair lank. The eyes were the grey of the sky outside. They
were the eyes that had looked upon a cloak the colour of a forgotten
sky. They were the same eyes. That was the only thread I had to
hold.</p>
<p><em>What were you?</em> I asked the water-blurred reflection. The
water did not answer. It only showed a man standing in a poor cottage,
his hands dirty again from honest work, his thoughts treasonous against
the small life he led.</p>
<p>The memory did not come as a vision. It came as a skill.</p>
<p>My gaze fell upon the latch of the cottage door. A simple, rusted
piece of iron, a wooden bar that slid into a bracket. I had opened it
ten thousand times. But now, I <em>saw</em> it. Not as a barrier, but as
a mechanism. I saw where the wood was worn smooth by the bar’s passage.
I saw the slight uplift needed to clear the bracket without a sound. I
saw, in my mind’s eye, a dozen other latches—finer, complex, wrought
with subtlety—and my fingers knew their tricks without my head recalling
their names.</p>
<p>It was a knowledge in the muscles. A memory in the bone.</p>
<p>I had not just worn silver. I had known how things worked. How they
opened. How they came apart.</p>
<p>This was the first gift the chest had given me: not a scene, but a
capacity. The past was not returning as a story, but as a set of tools.
I flexed my hands. They were a farmer’s hands, calloused and strong. But
they were also <em>these</em> hands. The hands that had known the weight
of a circlet. The hands that understood latches.</p>
<p>The rain began then, a soft, persistent pattering on the thatch. It
was the only sound. I sat on my stool by the dead fire, and I did not
think of turnips, or rent, or Baldric’s disappointment. I thought of
geometry. The arch in the cellar wall was not just an arch. It was a
statement. It was a choice. Someone had built it, not for strength
alone, but for a meaning I could not yet parse. The keystone was its
heart. Its purpose.</p>
<p>And the room beyond it… that was a choice of a different order. Not a
statement to the world, but a secret kept from it. A box within a box. A
memory within a stone.</p>
<p>The rain drummed its fingers on the roof. I waited. The waiting was
now a different kind of work.</p>
<p>Baldric returned as the light was failing, soaked and empty-handed,
his temper a black cloud in the small room. He stoked the fire to a
spiteful blaze, hung his wet clothes, and glowered at me. “You’ve been
sitting there all afternoon like a carved saint.”</p>
<p>“Thinking,” I said.</p>
<p>“A dangerous pastime.”</p>
<p>“More dangerous than eel fishing in a storm?”</p>
<p>His eyes narrowed. There was a new tone in my voice, and he had heard
it. It was not defiance, exactly. It was a removal. A distance. I was
speaking to him from across a gap he could not see.</p>
<p>Supper was a silent, tense affair. The rain hissed down the chimney.
I ate my portion of boiled grain and felt the two selves within me
sitting at the same table. The one that accepted this as his lot. The
one that was planning a burglary of his own history.</p>
<p>When Baldric finally banked the fire and retreated to his alcove, his
snores soon rumbling through the cottage, I lay on my pallet and stared
into the gloom. The sound of the rain was a curtain. Behind it, I walked
the path to the copse again. I retrieved the bundle from the hollow
tree. The cloth was damp, but the things inside were dry. I did not take
them out. I felt their shapes through the wool: the hard line of the
bar, the soft bulk of the cloak, the cool, coiled promise of the
circlet.</p>
<p>I had brought them back. They were hidden under a loose floor-stone
near my pallet, a childish hiding place that was perfect because Baldric
would never credit me with enough initiative to have a secret worth
hiding. The weight of them under the earth was a lodestone. It pulled at
me.</p>
<p>The rain slackened after midnight, fading to a drip. In the absolute
dark, I rose. I did not light a candle. I moved by the memory of the
room’s dimensions, a memory that was now precise, mathematical. I knelt,
pried up the stone with my fingers. The smell of cold soil rose up. I
reached in and drew out the circlet alone. It was cold, a band of
captured moonlight in my palm.</p>
<p>I did not put it on. I held it. I ran my thumb along the smooth inner
curve, the intricate, non-representational patterns on the outer face.
It was not decoration. It was language. A language of form and flow. My
thumb found a slight irregularity, a tiny catch in the metal. A join, so
perfect it was nearly invisible. I pressed it. Nothing happened. I
turned the circlet, feeling the weight distribution. It was not even. It
was <em>balanced</em>, but with a deliberate, subtle bias.</p>
<p>A tool. A key. A token.</p>
<p>The understanding was like a click in a lock deep inside my skull. I
had not been a lord. Lords wore crowns that shouted. This was a thing
that whispered. I had been a craftsman. A maker. A knower of secrets.
The silver was not for show; it was for a function I could not yet
recall.</p>
<p>The arch. The keystone. They were my work.</p>
<p>The certainty of it was a cold flood. It did not bring pride. It
brought a profound and chilling responsibility. I had built the arch. I
had designed its heart. And I had hidden a room behind it. What had I
been keeping in? Or keeping out?</p>
<p>I returned the circlet to its hiding place, covered it with the
stone. I lay back down. The cottage was the same. The world was not. I
was no longer a man searching for a past. I was a man beginning to
remember his crime. Or his duty. The two, I suspected, were often the
same thing.</p>
<p>The next two days were a study in forced normality. I worked the
fields. I ate Baldric’s grudging meals. I spoke little. He watched me,
his potato-face etched with deepening lines of confusion and annoyance.
The strange energy I radiated did not dissipate; it concentrated. I was
a pot coming slowly to a boil with the lid clamped shut.</p>
<p>On the third evening, as we sat in the smoky twilight, he could bear
it no longer. “Out with it,” he said, his voice rough.</p>
<p>“Out with what?”</p>
<p>“Whatever worm is gnawing at your brain. You’re here, but you’re not.
You look at me like you’re reading a signpost behind my head. It’s
uncanny.”</p>
<p>I met his gaze. He was my brother-in-law. He had, in his own pinched,
resentful way, kept a roof over my head when I was a vacant-eyed
stranger in his turnip field. He deserved some truth. But not the one I
had.</p>
<p>“I remember things,” I said, which was true.</p>
<p>“What things?”</p>
<p>“Fragments. Feelings. The way light falls through a high window. The
smell of a particular oil.” Also true.</p>
<p>He shifted uncomfortably. My lost memory had always been an
inconvenience, a flaw in his workforce. Its return was a threat. “What
good are feelings? Will they help us pay Sir Guy?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“Then dwell on something useful. Like the price of turnips at
market.”</p>
<p>He turned away, ending the conversation. The past, to Baldric, was
just another inefficient use of time. But he had given me an opening. A
question I needed to answer for myself.</p>
<p>What good were these memories? What good was a craftsman without his
craft, a knower of secrets who could not recall the secret?</p>
<p>The answer came the following morning, from an unexpected
quarter.</p>
<p>A rider came up the muddy track. Not Sir Guy’s man—his horse was
finer, his bearing straighter. He wore a dark cloak, and though his
clothes were travel-stained, they were well-made. He reined in at our
fence. Baldric emerged from the cottage, wiping his hands, his face a
mask of wary subservience.</p>
<p>“Goodman,” the rider said. His voice was educated, neutral. “I seek a
man. He may go by the name of Emrys. Or perhaps he uses no name at all.
He would be… forgetful. He has a skill with stone.”</p>
<p>The world did not slow. It sharpened. Every detail became a
needle-point: the way the rider’s gloved hand rested on his saddlebow,
the pattern of mud on his horse’s fetlocks, the slight, searching tilt
of his head as he looked past Baldric at the cottage, at me where I
stood in the doorway.</p>
<p>Baldric blinked. “Emrys? No, sir. No one here by that name. Just me
and my brother, Emeric. Simple folk.” He gestured vaguely at the fields.
“No stone-workers here. Just earth.”</p>
<p>The rider’s eyes found mine. They were a pale, watery blue. They held
no recognition, only a professional assessment. He looked at my
work-worn hands, my patched tunic, my face. He saw what Baldric saw: a
peasant. A turnip-farmer. The disguise was perfect because it was not a
disguise; it was the life I had lived for years.</p>
<p>But he was looking for a forgetful man with a skill for stone. He was
looking for me.</p>
<p>“I see,” the rider said, his tone flat. “My mistake. The information
was old.” He did not sound disappointed. He sounded like a man crossing
an item off a list. He nodded once, tugged his reins, and turned his
horse back down the track.</p>
<p>We watched him go until he was lost in the morning mist that clung to
the low ground.</p>
<p>Baldric let out a long, shaky breath. “Odd business. Looking for a
stone-man out here.” He glanced at me, a flicker of his old suspicion
returning. “You don’t know anything about stone, do you?”</p>
<p>“No,” I said, the lie smooth and easy. “Nothing at all.”</p>
<p>He grunted, satisfied, and went back inside.</p>
<p>I remained in the doorway. The mist curled around my ankles. The
rider had not come from Sir Guy. He had come from the <em>past</em>. He
had spoken a name that was not quite mine—Emrys, a breath away from
Emeric—and he had described my condition with a chilling accuracy.
<em>Forgetful. A skill with stone.</em></p>
<p>They were still looking. Whoever had put me in this field, whoever
the arch and the room were meant to thwart, they had not given up. The
search was quiet, professional, relentless. Jarvis, with his watchful
silence, was one kind of sentinel. This rider was another. They were the
two edges of a pincer I had only just felt closing.</p>
<p>The memory was not just a return. It was a risk. A beacon. The moment
I truly became what I had been, I would be seen.</p>
<p>I had thought my next step was into the light of the past. I was
wrong. The past had its own shadows, and they were hunting.</p>
<p>That night, the decision made itself. I could not wait. I could not
slowly reassemble myself in the safety of this forgotten field. Safety
was an illusion. The rider proved it. The chest was not just a answer;
it was a weapon. A tool kit for a war I did not understand.</p>
<p>I had to go back. Not just to look, but to take. To learn. To arm
myself.</p>
<p>I waited for the deep of the night, when Baldric’s snores were a
steady rumble. I moved with the silence that was now a remembered skill.
I retrieved the bundle from under the floor. This time, I did not leave
the circlet. I took it all. I folded the cloak small and tight. I
slipped the iron bar through my belt. The circlet I wrapped in a scrap
of leather and put in the pouch at my waist.</p>
<p>I stood for a moment in the dark cottage. I looked at Baldric’s
curtain, at the glow of the banked fire. This had been my whole world. A
small, hard, mean world. But it had been a shelter. I felt no grand
farewell. Only a vague, distant gratitude, like a man nodding to a shed
that has kept off the rain.</p>
<p>Then I turned and left, closing the door softly on the man named
Emeric the turnip farmer. He was a shell I was stepping out of.</p>
<p>The night was clear and cold, the moon a shaving of bone. I did not
go to the copse. I went straight for the village, for Jarvis’s house,
moving not as a shadow fleeing, but as a tool moving toward its purpose.
The memory in my bones guided my feet. I avoided the main paths, took
the old, overgrown ways, my senses stretched wide. I saw the village
from the ridge, a cluster of dark shapes under the stars. Jarvis’s house
was the largest, a solid block of darkness.</p>
<p>I circled to the rear, to the garden wall. My hands found the holds
without thought. I was over and down, a drop into the scent of damp
herbs and turned earth. The house was silent. No light showed.</p>
<p>The pantry window was as I had left it, the latch unhooked. I slid it
open, the sound a mere sigh. I was inside. The cool, dry air of the
cellar washed over me. I did not hesitate. I went to the arch.</p>
<p>In the absolute dark, I laid my hands upon the stones. My fingers
knew them. They traced the joints, the coursing, the subtle curve. I had
built this. Not with these calloused hands, but with the knowledge that
now stirred within them. I felt for the keystone, the centre of the
tension. It was not just missing. It had been <em>removed</em>. With
great care. By someone who knew its function.</p>
<p>Me.</p>
<p>I had taken out my own heart. And hidden it.</p>
<p>I passed under the arch. The corridor was a breath of colder air. I
did not need my stolen tallow dip. I moved by memory and touch, one hand
on the wall, counting my steps. The door to the room was ahead.
Locked.</p>
<p>I knelt before it. My fingers explored the lock plate. It was not a
simple mechanism. It was a puzzle. A series of interlocking wards, a
counter-weighted tumbler. My mind saw it, disassembled it. My hands, in
the dark, felt for the tension, for the sweet spot. The iron bar was too
crude. I needed a whisper, not a shout.</p>
<p>From my pouch, I drew two thin, hardened strips of horn I had
fashioned from a discarded bucket during the long afternoon in the
field. They were poor tools. But they were <em>my</em> tools. I inserted
them into the keyhole. The world shrank to the tips of my fingers, to
the faint pressure transmitted through the horn. I listened with my
skin.</p>
<p>A pressure. A slight give. A click, softer than a mouse’s
footstep.</p>
<p>The door swung inward.</p>
<p>The room was as I had left it. The chest sat in the centre of the
geometric tiles. The air was still, holding its breath.</p>
<p>This time, I did not simply look. I opened the chest fully. I lifted
out the cloak. In the profound dark, I could not see its colour, but I
felt its texture, the impossible lightness, the way it seemed to drink
the warmth from my hands. I put it around my shoulders. It settled with
a weight that was not physical, a familiarity that was a homecoming and
a sentence. It was cold. It was meant to be cold.</p>
<p>I took the circlet from my pouch. I did not put it on my brow. I held
it before me, turning it in the dark. My thumb found the irregularity
again, the join. I pressed, and this time, I twisted, applying pressure
in the direction of the circlet’s subtle imbalance.</p>
<p>With a tiny, precise <em>snick</em>, the circlet split along a seam I
had never seen. It opened like a locket. Inside the band, hidden in its
thickness, were not jewels, but tools. Minute, exquisite tools of silver
and dark, hardened steel. Picks, probes, tension wrenches, a slender saw
no longer than my thumb. A master’s set. A thief’s set. A locksmith’s
liturgy.</p>
<p>I stared at them, gleaming dully in the faint starlight that filtered
from some unseen vent high above. My hands began to shake. Not with
fear. With recognition. This was my true craft. Not the grand
architecture of arches, but the secret geometry of locks. The art of
opening. The science of the hidden way.</p>
<p>The keystone was not just the heart of the arch. It was a lock. And I
had made the key. Then I had hidden both.</p>
<p>I closed the circlet, the seam vanishing. I looked at the chest. It
was empty now, save for the faint scent of cedar and time. It had held
my uniform. My tools. My purpose.</p>
<p>I was not a lord. I was not a simple craftsman.</p>
<p>I was a Warden. A keeper of thresholds. A man who built locks and
knew the ways around them. The arch was a door I had made. The keystone
was the key I had taken. The room was my sanctuary. And the things
hunting me—the rider, the silence that pressed on Jarvis, the whole
oppressive weight of this arranged amnesia—were what I had been set here
to guard against.</p>
<p>But what was on the other side of the arch?</p>
<p>I turned from the chest. I looked at the wall opposite the door. In
my first visit, I had thought it blank. Now, with the cloak on my
shoulders and the circlet in my hand, I saw the lines. Faint, etched
into the stone. A map. A diagram of the house above, and below it,
tunnels. A network. And at its centre, not a room, but a symbol: a
single, perfect keystone.</p>
<p>I had not just hidden myself. I had hidden the way.</p>
<p>The sound was so faint it was almost a thought. A scrape of boot on
stone, somewhere in the cellar beyond the arch. Not the careless shuffle
of Jarvis. This was the careful, placed step of a man who knew the value
of silence.</p>
<p>They were here.</p>
<p>Not searching. They had found the outer door. They were inside.</p>
<p>I had remembered what I was just in time to be caught by what I
feared.</p>
<p>I slipped the circlet into my pouch. The cloak I kept around me. It
did not rustle. It made no sound at all. I took the iron bar in my hand.
It was a crude thing, but it had a heft.</p>
<p>I moved to the door of the room, peered out into the deeper black of
the corridor. A light bloomed, small and shielded—a shuttered lantern.
It illuminated a slice of wall, a man’s hand, the hilt of a sword.</p>
<p>They were between me and the arch. Between me and the world.</p>
<p>I closed the door of the room silently. I did not lock it. A lock
would tell them this was the place. I stood in the perfect dark, my back
against the cold stone. The geometric tiles beneath my feet seemed to
hum with a low, waiting frequency.</p>
<p>The footsteps came closer, paused outside the arch. A low voice
murmured, indecipherable. Then the light moved, probing past the arch,
down the corridor toward me.</p>
<p>They had not found the door yet. They were checking the cellar
proper. But they would. They were thorough.</p>
<p>I had two choices. Wait, and be found in my sanctuary. Or move, and
meet them in the dark.</p>
<p>The cloak felt like a second skin, a skin that knew how to hide. The
tools in the circlet were for opening. The bar in my hand was for
breaking.</p>
<p>I was a Warden. My duty was to guard the way. But the way was inside
me now. The only thing left to guard was the knowledge itself.</p>
<p>The light swept the corridor again, closer. It touched the edge of my
door.</p>
<p>I took a breath, a silent sip of the cold, still air. I remembered my
name. I remembered my craft.</p>
<p>And I remembered that every lock, in the end, exists to be
opened—from one side or the other.</p>
<p>The hook of light caught the iron latch of my door. It paused.</p>
<p>In the stillness, I heard the sound of my own future: the soft,
inevitable intake of breath before the question, the demand, the
violence. They were not here for turnips, or rent. They were here for
the man who wore the colour of a forgotten sky. They were here for the
key.</p>
<p>And I was no longer in the field. I was in the lock. And I had the
tools.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-18">Chapter 18</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-18-1"><strong>CHAPTER 18</strong></h2>
<p>The hook of light on the latch was a question. It asked, <em>Is
anyone home?</em> It asked, <em>Is the prize inside?</em> The light was
patient, methodical. It was the light of men who got paid for answers,
not for haste.</p>
<p>I was not home. I was a vacancy. I was the dust in the corner, the
chill in the stone, the absence where a man should be. The cloak drank
the light that grazed its hem. It made no argument with the
darkness.</p>
<p>A boot scuffed the geometric tiles outside. The murmur came again,
closer. “…archivist said the lower cellar. This is it. Check the
walls.”</p>
<p>The voice was dry, precise. It was not Baldric’s voice, full of
turnips and missing teeth. It was not Sir Guy’s, bloated with
entitlement. This was a new voice. A professional voice. It had no
interest in my name, only in my function.</p>
<p><em>The man who wore the colour of a forgotten sky.</em> They had a
phrase for me. That was something. It was more than I’d had in the
turnip field.</p>
<p>The light slid away from the latch. It swept down the corridor,
probing the opposite wall. I heard the tap of a knuckle on stone, the
hollow, searching sound of a man looking for a secret. They would find
the door. The geometry of the place led to it. The archivist, whoever
that was, had given them a map. My sanctuary was a marked square on a
ledger.</p>
<p>I had chosen, back in the stillness. I had chosen to move. But moving
now, into the path of that searching light, was the action of a panicked
animal. A Warden did not panic. A Warden assessed the mechanism. The men
were the tumblers. Their light was the lever. Their expectation was the
shear line.</p>
<p>They expected a fugitive. A man cowering in a hole. They expected the
prize to be hidden in a place.</p>
<p>The prize was not in a place. The prize was a pattern in my mind, a
map of pressure and alignment I had absorbed from the circlet, from the
silent song of the tiles. The way was inside me. The knowledge was the
only thing left to guard. Therefore, I was not a fugitive guarding a
secret. I was a secret, wearing a man.</p>
<p>The realisation was a key turning in a lock I hadn’t known was there.
It did not click. It <em>settled</em>. My breath, already slow, became a
negligible thing. The weight of the iron bar in my hand was not a
threat. It was a misdirection.</p>
<p>The light tapped back toward my door. This time, it did not pause on
the latch. It held. A shadow cut across the light—a man leaning in. His
fingers, blunt and gloved, closed around the iron ring. He did not try
it. He knew it would be locked. He was deciding whether to call for a
ram, or to try the picks his partner doubtlessly carried.</p>
<p>I was not in the room. I was in the lock. And from inside the lock,
you feel every vibration.</p>
<p>I let the iron bar slip from my fingers. It fell. It did not clatter.
I caught it against my thigh with a soft, muffled thud of wool and
flesh, then lowered it silently to the tiles between my feet. The sound
it made was the sound of a thought being discarded. It was nothing. It
was less than a rat in the wall.</p>
<p>The man outside heard nothing. He made his decision. “Locks,” he
said, the word flat.</p>
<p>A second shadow joined the first. The light jostled. I heard the
clink of a leather roll being unfolded, the cold kiss of steel tools
touching one another. The second man was a virtuoso. His picks would be
elegant, specific. He would respect the lock. He would seek its
consent.</p>
<p>He did not know the lock was empty.</p>
<p>The first pick slid into the keyhole. I felt it as a distant
pressure, a whisper against the silence of my door. The man worked with
a delicate tension, listening for the fall of the wards. He was good. In
ten heartbeats, he would be inside.</p>
<p>In nine, I moved.</p>
<p>I did not move toward the door. I moved away from it, down the short,
dead-end corridor that terminated at the blank stone of the cellar’s
outer wall. Five paces. The light was at my back, focused on the
keyhole. I was a deeper patch of dark, retreating into a cul-de-sac. A
trap.</p>
<p>Eight heartbeats.</p>
<p>I reached the wall. My hands, bare now, found the cold stone. It was
rough, mortared, ordinary. But beneath my fingertips, the geometry
persisted. The tiles on the floor here were chipped, covered in grit,
but the pattern—the pattern the circlet had shown me—was a river flowing
beneath the surface. It did not end at the wall. It turned.</p>
<p>Seven.</p>
<p>My fingers traced the invisible lines. Pressure here. A shift of
weight there. The memory was not in my head. It was in my hands. They
remembered the craft before I remembered my name. The stone was not a
barrier. It was a panel in a great, silent instrument.</p>
<p>Six.</p>
<p>I braced my shoulder against a specific point, low and to the left. I
set my feet on two specific tiles, feeling their faint, resonant hum
through the soles of my boots. I became a living key, a configuration of
force.</p>
<p>Five.</p>
<p>I pushed. Not with the brute strength of a shoulder against a ram.
With the aligned, patient pressure of a lever in a well-oiled
mechanism.</p>
<p>Four.</p>
<p>The stone gave. Not a grind, but a sigh. A section of wall, perhaps
three feet wide and as high as my chest, pivoted inward on a central,
vertical pin. A draught of older, drier air sighed out, carrying the
scent of stale incense and cold clay.</p>
<p>Three.</p>
<p>The light behind me jostled. “Did you hear that?” The dry, precise
voice. A draught had reached them. A change in the stillness.</p>
<p>Two.</p>
<p>I did not look back. I scooped up the iron bar from the floor, slid
through the opening in the wall. The space beyond was blacker than
black, a throat of nothing.</p>
<p>One.</p>
<p>The lock behind me surrendered with a soft, definitive
<em>clunk</em>. The pickman had tripped the final ward. The door to my
room began to swing open.</p>
<p>I found the inner edge of the stone panel with my hands. I pulled. It
swung shut with a muffled, final <em>thud</em>, sealing me in absolute
darkness just as the shuttered lantern’s light flooded the empty room I
had left behind.</p>
<p>Silence. Then, from beyond the stone, muffled but clear: a curse. The
sound of boots on my floor. The scrape of the cot being overturned. The
hollow sound of a man kicking the empty strongbox.</p>
<p>“Gone,” said the precise voice. It was flatter now. Cold. “The
archivist was wrong. Or he lied.”</p>
<p>“The grate,” grunted another voice—the pickman. “In the ceiling. He
went up.”</p>
<p>“No dust disturbed. He didn’t go up. He vanished.”</p>
<p>“Men don’t vanish.”</p>
<p>“This one,” said the precise voice, “is not a man. He is a Warden. He
is a trick of the light.” A pause. The light swept the walls of my
former room, probing for my secret. It would not find it. The join in
the stone was perfect, known only to the geometry. “Search the cellar
again. He is a shadow. Find where the shadow is cast from.”</p>
<p>Their footsteps receded, back toward the arch. Their light faded,
leaving me in a darkness so complete it was a substance. I stood still,
waiting for my eyes to invent shapes. They invented nothing. This was a
dark that pre-dated eyes.</p>
<p>I had won. I had evaded them. I had used the knowledge I was sworn to
guard to preserve the knowledge itself. It was a neat, closed circle. A
perfect application of craft. I felt the cold thrill of it, the clean
satisfaction of a problem solved. I was out of the lock. I was in the
walls.</p>
<p>I took a step forward, hands outstretched. My foot came down on
nothing.</p>
<p>There was no floor.</p>
<p>The neat circle shattered. The satisfaction curdled into a free-fall
lurch in my gut. I dropped the iron bar. It vanished without a sound. I
windmilled my arms, pitching backward. My shoulders slammed against the
smooth, curving stone of the wall I had just entered. I scrabbled, nails
digging for purchase on seamless rock. My body slid, tilting into the
void.</p>
<p>I did not fall far. Three feet, perhaps. My boots hit a steep, smooth
slope of polished stone and shot out from under me. Then I was falling
in earnest, not down, but <em>along</em>, sliding on my back, gathering
speed down a sheer, dark channel. The cloak billowed around me, doing
nothing to slow my descent. The circlet on my brow was a band of cold
fire. I tried to dig in my heels, my elbows. The stone was glass-smooth,
worn by centuries of something that was not water.</p>
<p>The slide went on and on. It curved, once, twice, a spiral tightening
like a screw. The air grew colder, sharper. The scent of incense and
clay grew stronger, mixed now with the smell of still water and deep,
mineral time.</p>
<p>I had not won. I had chosen the wrong door. I had not escaped the
trap; I had committed myself to its final, elegant configuration. The
men with the lantern were a simple problem. This was the real lock. And
I was tumbling down its gullet.</p>
<p>The slope abruptly shallowed. My velocity bled away in a long,
grinding skid. I came to a rest on a level surface, my body aching, the
breath knocked from my lungs. I lay in the perfect dark, listening to
the thunder of my own heart.</p>
<p>Slowly, I pushed myself up. The stone beneath my palms was different.
Not the rough-cut blocks of the cellar, nor the polished slide. It was
fitted flagstone, large, perfectly square. I rose to my knees, then to
my feet. My limbs trembled, but they held.</p>
<p>I reached out. My fingers touched a wall. It was close. Too close. I
shuffled forward, one hand on the wall. Ten paces. A corner. I turned.
Ten more paces. Another corner. A room. A small, square room.</p>
<p>My boots scuffed something on the floor. Not stone. Something that
gave with a soft, desiccated crunch.</p>
<p>I knelt. My hands, trembling now for a different reason, explored the
floor before me. They found a shape. Long, slender. Bones. Fingers. A
human hand. The flesh was gone, the bones dry and cool. My tracing
fingers moved up. An arm. A ribcage. A skull, tilted back, the jaw agape
in a silent, final sigh.</p>
<p>I recoiled. My hand brushed another shape. Another skeleton. This one
was curled on its side.</p>
<p>I stood, my breath coming in short, sharp gasps that echoed in the
closed space. I took a step back, my foot landing on something that
rolled—a vertebra. I pinwheeled, arms outstretched.</p>
<p>My fingertips brushed something hanging in the centre of the
room.</p>
<p>I froze. I reached out again, slowly. My fingers closed around an
object. It was metal, cold, hanging from a chain fixed to the ceiling.
It was a brazier. A small, iron brazier.</p>
<p>Beneath it, my exploring foot found a pile of something granular.
Charcoal.</p>
<p>My mind, reeling, began to fit the pieces together with a dreadful,
mechanical certainty. A sealed room. A brazier. Charcoal. Skeletons.</p>
<p>It was not a room. It was a oubliette. A forgetting-place. But not
one for drowning or starvation. This was for a quieter, warmer oblivion.
You were placed here with the means to make light, to make heat. You lit
the charcoal. You burned away the air. You went to sleep, and you did
not wake up. It was a self-administered mercy, or a self-administered
execution. A final, elegant lock, and you were given the key.</p>
<p>The knowledge settled in me like a stone in a pond. This was where
Wardens came to die. When their duty was done, or when they were too
compromised to continue. When the knowledge they guarded was safer
extinguished with them.</p>
<p>I was not a Warden. I was a man who had found a Warden’s tools. I had
stolen a colour. I had followed a map I did not understand to its final,
terminal point.</p>
<p>I fumbled in the pouch at my belt. My flint and steel. I could make a
spark. I could light the charcoal. The thought was seductive, a soft,
warm voice in the absolute dark. <em>It’s what you do here. It’s how the
story ends. No more running. No more forgetting. Just a deep, quiet
sleep. You’ve earned it.</em></p>
<p>I clutched the flint in one hand, the steel in the other. They were
familiar. Their weight was an old truth. <em>Sorry buys no turnips.</em>
Baldric’s voice, suddenly clear in my memory. He was a potato-faced
bastard, but he was right. Sorry bought nothing. Surrender bought
less.</p>
<p>I was not done.</p>
<p>I sheathed the flint and steel. I turned from the brazier. My hands
went back to the walls, searching not for bones, but for seams, for
geometry, for the whisper of a pattern. This was a lock. Every lock has
a mechanism. Every mechanism has a purpose.</p>
<p>The walls were smooth, featureless. I made a circuit, then another,
my desperation growing. Nothing. A perfect, sealed cube. A coffin for
the mind.</p>
<p>I sank to the floor, my back against the wall, my head in my hands.
The circlet pressed against my brow. It was silent. It had led me here,
to the end of its song. It had done its duty. It had delivered the last
Warden to the forgetting-place.</p>
<p>But I was not the last Warden. I was Emeric. I was the man from the
turnip field. I had a brother-in-law named Baldric who was missing
teeth. I had owed rent to a Sir Guy. These were not grand memories. They
were small, dirty, human things. They were not the memories of a Warden.
They were <em>mine</em>.</p>
<p>The lens of memory and identity turned, and the deeper truth I had
missed scraped itself raw against my mind.</p>
<p>I had been asking the wrong question. I had been asking <em>what</em>
I had forgotten. The circlet, the tiles, the craft—they were all answers
to that question. They were the memories of the office, of the duty.
They were the <em>Warden’s</em> memories.</p>
<p>I had never asked <em>why</em> I forgot.</p>
<p>The answer was here, in the dark, surrounded by the bones of my
predecessors. We forgot because we had to. To carry the knowledge was a
burden. To be the living key was a sentence. The personal, the petty,
the human—the name Emeric, the face of Baldric, the weight of rent—these
were distractions. They were noise. They were shed, like a skin, to make
room for the pure, silent geometry of the craft. The forgetting was not
a flaw. It was the final ward. You surrendered your self to become the
guardian. And when the guardianship was over, you came here, and you
surrendered the rest.</p>
<p>I had not lost my memory. I had performed it. I had executed my own
identity to make space for the duty. The man in the turnip field wasn’t
suffering from a clerical error in the soul. He was the empty space left
after a carefully performed deletion.</p>
<p>And now the duty was done. The way was inside me, and I was in the
tomb. The mechanism was complete.</p>
<p>Except.</p>
<p>I opened my eyes in the dark. I looked toward where I knew the
brazier hung.</p>
<p>Except I had never chosen this. The man in the turnip field had not
chosen to forget. He had woken up that way. Someone, or something, had
performed the ritual on him. They had made him a Warden without his
consent. They had hollowed him out and filled him with a song of stone
and silence.</p>
<p>And then they had sent men with a lantern to find him.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>If I was meant to be here, in this quiet tomb, why was I being
hunted? If my end was this self-administered silence, why send
professionals to drag me back into the noise?</p>
<p>The archivist had told them where to find me. The archivist knew of
the lower cellar. The archivist was part of the mechanism. But he had
given them a map to an empty room. He had sent them to where I
<em>was</em>, not to where I was <em>supposed to be</em>. He had not
told them about the turning stone, the sliding channel, the
oubliette.</p>
<p>He was not trying to capture me. He was trying to flush me.</p>
<p>He was herding me toward this room.</p>
<p>A cold that had nothing to do with the air seeped into my bones. This
was not the end of the duty. This was a continuation of it. The final
test. A Warden who could be caught was not a true Warden. A Warden who
would light the brazier was a Warden who had accepted the terminus. A
Warden who did not…</p>
<p>A Warden who did not was something else. A Warden who remembered,
even a little. A Warden who asked why. A Warden who still had the dirty,
human coin of “sorry” in his mouth. A flawed Warden. A dangerous
Warden.</p>
<p>I was not here to die. I was here to choose.</p>
<p>And my choice had been made the moment I dropped the iron bar and did
not reach for the flint. I had chosen the turnip field over the
geometry. I had chosen Emeric over the Warden.</p>
<p>The knowledge was inside me. The way was my memory. And I was a man
who misplaced his own name. I was a corrupted key. A broken lock.</p>
<p>I stood up. My body did not tremble now. A strange clarity was upon
me, cold and sharp as the stone. I walked to the centre of the room. I
stood beneath the brazier. I reached up and took hold of the iron
chain.</p>
<p>I did not pull it to light the charcoal. I pulled it to test its
strength.</p>
<p>It held. It was anchored in the stone of the ceiling. I wrapped the
chain around my hands. I planted my feet on the flagstones, on the bones
of the ones who had chosen the sleep. I took my own weight.</p>
<p>I pulled.</p>
<p>The chain did not give. The ceiling did not crack. I hung from it, a
dead weight. Nothing.</p>
<p>I swung my body, putting lateral stress on the link where the chain
met the ceiling. I kicked my feet against the air, twisting, putting a
slow, grinding torque on the anchor point.</p>
<p>A sound. A faint, high protest of metal on stone.</p>
<p>I redoubled my effort. I was not trying to break the chain. I was
trying to unscrew it. I was trying to persuade the ceiling that its
fixture was under a new, unusual kind of pressure. The geometry of
force. A Warden’s craft.</p>
<p>With a sudden, gritty shriek, the anchor gave. A circular stone plug,
from which the chain depended, spun loose from the ceiling. It dropped,
and I dropped with it, landing in a heap of chain, iron, and dust.</p>
<p>I lay there, gasping. Above me, in the absolute black, was a hole. A
circular shaft, perhaps a foot wide, leading up into deeper darkness.
The chain had not been for the brazier. The brazier had been for the
occupant. The chain was for the mason who had installed the plug, to
pull it shut from above. It was the final seal. And I had just unscrewed
it.</p>
<p>I stood on shaking legs. I could not reach the shaft. It was eight
feet above me. The walls were smooth.</p>
<p>I looked down at the chain in my hands, at the heavy stone plug
attached to its end. I looked at the skeletons on the floor.</p>
<p>Sorry buys no turnips. But ingenuity, perhaps, buys a way out.</p>
<p>I moved to the largest skeleton, the one lying on its back. “Forgive
me,” I whispered to the empty dark. The words were not foreign now. They
were the only coin I had. I took the bones of the arms, the legs. I used
the length of the chain to bind them together, crudely, with the iron
plug as a central weight. I fashioned a rough, macabre grapnel.</p>
<p>I stood beneath the shaft. I swung the bone-and-iron hook in a
widening circle, then let it fly upward, into the hole.</p>
<p>The first time, it clattered against the side and fell back in a rain
of bone fragments. The second time, it caught. I heard the iron plug
wedge against something in the shaft. I pulled, gently. It held.</p>
<p>I did not trust it with my full weight. I would have to climb
quickly, before the bones shattered or the plug dislodged.</p>
<p>I took the chain in my hands. I put my feet against the wall. And I
began to climb, hand over hand, up into the waiting dark, leaving the
forgetting-place below.</p>
<p>The climb was a agony of strain and fear. The bone links creaked and
popped. Once, a femur snapped, and I slipped, dangling by one hand
before I found another purchase. The shaft was narrow, tight, a stone
throat swallowing me. I climbed for an eternity, the only sound my
ragged breath and the protesting grind of ancient remains.</p>
<p>Then, my reaching hand found not another link of chain, but a lip of
stone. An edge. I hauled myself up, my shoulders scraping against the
shaft, and tumbled out onto a cold, dusty floor.</p>
<p>I lay there, panting, surrounded by a different kind of darkness.
This was not the absolute black of the oubliette. This was a gloom
pierced by distant, faint points of light. High above, tiny square
windows, covered in grime, let in the diluted grey of moonlight. I was
in a vast, empty space. The air smelled of dust, old hay, and the faint,
metallic tang of the sky.</p>
<p>I pushed myself to my knees. I was in a loft. A barn, or a granary.
Great, empty rafters soared above. Below, through gaps in the
floorboards, I saw more darkness, the suggestion of a large, open
area.</p>
<p>I had climbed out of the earth. I was back in the world.</p>
<p>But it was not my world. Not the turnip field, not the town with Sir
Guy’s manor. This place was too large, too empty. I crawled to one of
the grimy windows and wiped a patch clear with the edge of my cloak.</p>
<p>I looked out on a landscape of moon-washed ruins. Tumbledown walls,
the skeletal ribs of a great roof, the jagged teeth of a collapsed bell
tower against the sky. I was in the upper storey of a derelict church,
or a monastery, built on a rise. Below and around it, the ruins spread
like a stone infection. And beyond the ruins, encircling them, was a
high, dark wall. A perimeter. And on that wall, I saw the moving,
distant specks of lanterns. Patrols.</p>
<p>The archivist had not herded me to a tomb. He had herded me to a
prison. A forgotten ruin, walled off from the world. This was not a
Warden’s retirement. This was a Warden’s archive. A living one. Where
they kept the broken keys, the flawed locks, the ones who remembered
enough to be dangerous, but not enough to be free.</p>
<p>I was not out. I was in a larger cell. And the men with the lanterns
were not just hunters. They were guards.</p>
<p>I sat back from the window, the cold of the stone floor seeping
through my clothes. The false victory of the cellar was ash in my mouth.
I had escaped the small dark only to find myself in a greater one. I had
remembered my name only to realise it was a label on a shelf.</p>
<p>The hook for the next turn of the mechanism was not a question of
where I would go. It was a question of what I was. A Warden? Emeric? A
prisoner? A key?</p>
<p>I looked at my hands in the dim grey light. They were dirty. They
were mine. And they were, for the moment, unobserved.</p>
<p>Outside, on the wall, a lantern paused. It seemed to point toward my
window, a single, watchful eye in the vast, sleeping dark. It held its
gaze for three long breaths.</p>
<p>Then it moved on, continuing its endless, patient circuit.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-19">Chapter 19</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-19-1"><strong>CHAPTER 19</strong></h2>
<p>The lantern moved on, but its afterimage stayed, burned onto the back
of my eyes. A watchful eye. I had been seen, or I had not. The
distinction felt academic, like debating the temperature of a fire while
standing in its flames. The fact of the wall was the fact. The fact of
the patrols was the fact. The fact of this vast, ruined cage was the
fact.</p>
<p>I was in a larger cell. The archivist, with his dry voice and his
drier hands, had not lied. He had simply offered a larger definition of
retirement. A Warden’s archive. A place for broken keys.</p>
<p>I sat with my back against the cold plaster of the wall, beneath the
grimy window. The air here was different from the cellar’s. It was not
the thick, damp breath of the earth, but a thin, sharp exhalation of
decay. Stone dust, old mortar, the ghost of incense and mildew. It was
the smell of something that had been abandoned by everyone except the
wind.</p>
<p>My hands were still dirty. I rubbed the thumb of one hand against the
palm of the other. The grit was real. The cold was real. The hunger, a
hollow, grinding knot below my ribs, was profoundly real. These were the
facts of Emeric. The turnip-field man. The man who forgot.</p>
<p>But the other fact, the one that sat beside me like a silent
companion, was the memory of the mechanism. The feel of the lever in the
cellar wall, the precise resistance, the click of release. That was not
Emeric’s memory. That was a Warden’s memory. A key’s memory.</p>
<p>I was both. I was the label on the shelf and the thing shelved. A
clerical error in the soul.</p>
<p>The grey light at the window deepened, not toward dawn, but toward a
fuller, more decisive night. The moon was high. It was time to move. To
sit was to be catalogued. I pushed myself up, my joints protesting like
rusted hinges.</p>
<p>The room I was in was large, perhaps a chapter house or a refectory.
Fallen timbers lay like the bones of a great beast across shattered
tiles. I picked my way through the debris, my steps sounding obscenely
loud in the monumental silence. Every crunch of plaster underfoot was a
declaration. <em>Here I am. Come and find me.</em></p>
<p>But no one came. The only answer was the sigh of the wind through a
hundred broken windows.</p>
<p>I reached a doorway, its door long since rotted away. Beyond it, a
corridor stretched, a tunnel of deeper shadow. I had no plan, which was
its own kind of plan. To move was to learn the shape of the cage. To
learn the shape of the cage was to find its flaw. Every lock had one.
Even a living archive.</p>
<p>The corridor led to a staircase, half-collapsed. I climbed what
remained, my hands finding purchase on cold, rough stone. It brought me
to a higher walkway, open to the sky, that ran along the inner perimeter
of what must have been the monastery’s central cloister. Below was a
square of wilderness, where weeds and saplings had thrust up through the
flagstones, pale in the moonlight.</p>
<p>From this vantage, the scale of the prison revealed itself. The ruins
were extensive—a church, outbuildings, dormitories—all contained within
that immense, encircling wall. The wall was not stone, I saw now. It was
something smoother, darker. It looked poured, not built. It absorbed the
moonlight rather than reflecting it. And along its top, at precise
intervals, the lanterns moved. Their paths were not random. They were
circuits, timed, mechanical. The routine of a perpetual, patient
guard.</p>
<p>This was not a place built to keep people out. It was built to keep
us in. The ones who remembered.</p>
<p>A sound froze me. Not the wind. A soft, rhythmic scrape. Like a broom
on stone, but slower. Heavier.</p>
<p>It came from the cloister below. I sank down behind the parapet of
the walkway, peering through a crumbling notch.</p>
<p>A figure moved through the weeds. It was a man, or had been. He was
painfully thin, wrapped in a tattered cloak that might once have been a
Warden’s grey. His head was down, and he was dragging something—a length
of rusted chain—behind him. He walked in a slow, deliberate circle
around the cloister garth, his feet tracing the same path over and over,
polishing a ghost of a path in the debris. His lips moved. He was
talking, or counting, or reciting.</p>
<p>Another broken key.</p>
<p>As I watched, a second figure emerged from a shadowed arch. A woman,
her hair a wild grey cloud. She carried a bundle of sticks. She did not
look at the man with the chain. She walked to the center of the garth,
knelt, and began to arrange the sticks with fastidious care, as if
building a tiny, logical fortress.</p>
<p>They did not acknowledge each other. They were alone together, each
in their own private archive of ritual.</p>
<p>This was the retirement. Not peace, but isolation. Not silence, but
the endless, internal noise of a single memory, played on a loop until
it wore a groove in the soul. The archivist had not needed to lock us in
cells. He had given us rooms in our own minds, and we had locked the
doors ourselves.</p>
<p>I felt a cold that had nothing to do with the night. This was my
future. To walk in circles, dragging my chain. To build tiny, perfect
structures that meant nothing. To be Emeric, or to be the Warden,
forever, until the distinction dissolved into madness.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>The word was quiet, but it was solid. It was a stone in my gut.
<em>No.</em></p>
<p>I was not yet that broken. I had remembered the mechanism. I had
climbed out of the earth. These hands, dirty as they were, had done
that. They could do more.</p>
<p>I retreated from the parapet. The walkway led to the shell of the
church. I slipped inside through a gap where a great rose window had
once been. The nave was a cathedral of emptiness. The roof was mostly
gone, and pillars stood like petrified trees holding up a ceiling of
stars. At the far end, the altar was a solid block of shadow.</p>
<p>I moved down the side aisle, keeping to the deeper pools of darkness.
My eyes adjusted. Details emerged. Scratches on the walls. Not random.
Diagrams. Faded, half-finished circles with intricate geometries.
Equations. Fragments of script in languages I did not know, but whose
shapes felt familiar in my marrow. Other Wardens had been here. Other
keys. They had tried to write their memories on the walls, to
externalize the mechanism before it was lost inside them.</p>
<p>I ran my fingers over a series of precise marks near the floor. They
were a sequence of pressures, a locking tumble rendered in stone. I knew
it. It was the sequence for a Vault of Seasonal Melancholy, a minor
archive. The memory rose, clean and sharp. I could have opened it.</p>
<p>But there was no vault here. Only the wall. The marks were a ghost of
a function. A useless memory.</p>
<p>“You see it too.”</p>
<p>The voice was a dry rustle, like pages turning. I spun.</p>
<p>He stood in the arch of a side chapel, a silhouette against the
lesser dark. He was tall, stooped. As he stepped forward, the moonlight
caught his face. It was narrow, austere, the skin pulled tight over the
bones. His eyes were dark pools, but they held a sharp, un-extinguished
focus. He was not like the others in the cloister. His madness, if
that’s what it was, was cold and coherent.</p>
<p>“The patterns,” he said. His voice was the archivist’s voice, but
without the dust. It was the voice of a head clerk. “They try to map the
interior onto the exterior. A futile translation. The wall does not care
for tumblers or sequences.”</p>
<p>I said nothing. My hand had closed around a loose piece of stone in
the rubble at my feet.</p>
<p>“You are new,” he stated. “The disturbance in the lower cellar. The
opened door. That was you.” He tilted his head. “You remember the
procedures. But do you remember why you are here?”</p>
<p>“I remember a turnip field,” I said.</p>
<p>A faint, thin smile touched his lips. “The pastoral defense. A common
one. The mind clings to the mundane as an anchor against the profound.
My anchor was a ledger. Columns of figures. The weight of silver.” He
took another step. He wore remnants of grey, but they were clean,
mended. “I am Alaric. I was the Keeper of the Quantitative Vault. I
remembered the numbers. All of them. The sums, the dates, the balances
of a thousand hidden transactions.”</p>
<p>“What happened?”</p>
<p>“I began to see the pattern in the numbers,” he said, as if
explaining a simple truth to a child. “Not just our records. The numbers
<em>underneath</em>. The mathematics of forgetting. The archivist deemed
the knowledge… unstable. A key that understands the composition of the
lock is a danger to the entire architecture.” He spread his hands. “So I
was retired. As you have been.”</p>
<p>“This isn’t retirement. It’s a storage room.”</p>
<p>“It is both,” Alaric said. “We are the flawed instruments. The ones
with a burr on the teeth, a warp in the blade. We cannot be trusted with
the world’s secrets, but we cannot be un-made. So we are placed here.
The wall keeps the world out. And our own fading minds keep the secrets
in. It is an elegant solution.”</p>
<p>He sounded like he admired it. The clinical efficiency of his own
imprisonment.</p>
<p>“There must be a way out,” I said.</p>
<p>“Of course there is,” he replied. “There is a gate. In the wall. It
is made of white oak banded with iron. It has three locks, each of a
different principle. I know the sequences for all three.”</p>
<p>Hope, a stupid, fragile bird, fluttered in my chest. “Then—”</p>
<p>“I have no desire to open it,” he interrupted, his voice flattening.
“Where would I go? To a world that has no need for my numbers? To a life
where the profound pattern is obscured by turnip fields and petty
silver? Here, I am what I am. Out there, I would be a ghost. Or worse, a
man.”</p>
<p>His certainty was a wall as solid as the one that encircled us. He
had made his peace with the cage. He was a willing shelf.</p>
<p>“You are still divided,” he observed, studying me. “The man and the
Warden. You feel the conflict. It is painful. It will not last. You will
choose, or the choice will be made for you. You will become like the
chain-dragger downstairs, fixated on one loop of memory. Or you will
become like me, and see the prison as the only logical place.”</p>
<p>“Or I’ll find the gate,” I said.</p>
<p>He nodded, as if I’d confirmed a theorem. “The third phase. Brief,
and always ending in the fourth.” He pointed a long, pale finger toward
the east. “The gate is there. In the oldest part of the wall, where the
guard’s circuit is most frequent. You will not open it. But the attempt
will be instructive. It will help you move toward your resolution.”</p>
<p>He turned and walked back into the shadows of the side chapel. “Good
luck, Emeric. Or whatever you are.”</p>
<p>I stood alone in the skeletal nave. The moon had moved. The shadows
of the pillars had stretched, like bars across the broken floor.
Alaric’s words were a cold seed in my mind. <em>You will not open
it.</em></p>
<p>But the memory of the mechanism in the cellar was warmer. The click
of release. The false wall giving way.</p>
<p>I looked at my hands. They were dirty. They were mine. They were the
hands of a man who forgot, and the hands of a Warden who remembered. The
conflict was the pain. But it was also the potential. The chain-dragger
had chosen one memory. Alaric had chosen the logic of the cage. I was
still choosing.</p>
<p>I moved east.</p>
<p>The ruins grew older, more thoroughly collapsed. The poured wall
loomed closer, a sheer, dark cliff against the starfield. The patrols
were more visible here. I could see the shapes of the guards behind the
lanterns. They moved in pairs, their steps synchronized. They did not
look down into the ruins often. Their gaze was outward, over the top of
the wall. Their job was to keep things out. Keeping us in was assumed by
the architecture, and by our own minds.</p>
<p>I found the gate.</p>
<p>It was exactly as Alaric had described. A massive arch of white oak,
blackened with age, bound with straps of iron thick as my arm. It was
set into the wall, a profound and obvious discontinuity. And it had
three locks. Each was a heavy, complex iron box, set at eye, chest, and
waist height. They were not like the hidden mechanisms of the Wardens.
These were blunt, physical, definitive. They were not meant to be
subtle. They were meant to be impossible.</p>
<p>I approached from the cover of a fallen buttress. The gate was
illuminated by a lone, stationary lantern mounted high on the wall above
it. A dead zone. The patrols passed to the left and right of this spot,
their circuits meeting and parting like clockwork sentinels.</p>
<p>I studied the locks. The highest was a puzzle lock, with sliding
plates engraved with celestial symbols. The middle was a combination
lock, with five concentric rings of letters. The lowest was a keyhole,
large enough to take a key the length of my hand.</p>
<p>I knew the first one. The celestial symbols were not arbitrary; they
were a star-map sequence for the autumnal equinox, used to seal a Vault
of Harvest Secrets. My fingers itched with the memory. I could solve
that lock in ten heartbeats.</p>
<p>The second, the letters… I stared at the rings. They wanted a word. A
password. Five letters. My mind, the Warden’s mind, scrolled through
possibilities. Codes, ciphers, mottos. Nothing fit. This was not a
Warden’s lock. This was something else.</p>
<p>The third required a physical key. A thing I did not have.</p>
<p>Alaric was right. I could not open it. Not alone.</p>
<p>A new sound cut through the wind. Not the scrape of a chain. Not the
steps of a patrol. This was a low, rhythmic <em>thump</em>. Like a
heartbeat from the earth.</p>
<p>It came from behind me, deep within the ruins. A slow, deliberate
percussion.</p>
<p>I left the gate and followed the sound. It led me away from the wall,
toward the central, most intact structure—the old church tower, its top
shattered, but its base still solid. The thumping grew louder. It had a
metallic resonance.</p>
<p>The tower’s ground-floor chamber had a low, arched entrance.
Firelight flickered within, casting a dancing, orange glow onto the
rubble outside.</p>
<p>I edged to the side of the arch and looked in.</p>
<p>A forge had been built inside. A crude hearth, bellows made from
animal skins and hollowed logs. A man stood at an anvil. He was huge,
shoulders like sacks of grain, his back to me. He was hammering a piece
of metal. <em>Thump</em>. Pause. <em>Thump</em>. Pause. Each blow was
measured, perfect in its force.</p>
<p>On a stone shelf beside him lay rows of objects. Nails. Hinges.
Hooks. And keys. Dozens of iron keys, of all sizes, in various states of
completion.</p>
<p>The blacksmith.</p>
<p>He was another prisoner. Another broken key. But his breaking had
left him with this: the need to make. To shape metal. To solve problems
of physical reality.</p>
<p>He finished hammering, examined the glowing metal—a long, slender
shaft—and plunged it into a barrel of water with a furious hiss. Steam
billowed, filling the chamber with a warm, mineral smell.</p>
<p>He turned to select another blank from a pile, and the firelight
caught his face. It was broad, flat, seamed with soot and old scars. His
eyes were small, bright points of focus. He saw the world in terms of
heat and force, shape and function.</p>
<p>This was not a man lost in a memory. This was a man using his hands
to remember what he was.</p>
<p>I stepped into the archway. The heat from the forge washed over
me.</p>
<p>He saw me immediately. His eyes flicked up, then back to his work. He
did not seem surprised. “Cold night,” he said. His voice was the grating
of iron on stone.</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said.</p>
<p>“The new one,” he stated. He picked up a new piece of metal, studied
it, and placed it in the heart of the coals. “The archivist’s latest
mistake.”</p>
<p>“You know why I’m here?”</p>
<p>“Everyone here is a mistake,” he said, working the bellows. The coals
pulsed like a living heart. “A key that doesn’t turn right. A lock that
sticks. I was a Maker. I built the boxes for the smaller secrets. I
remembered the stresses of metal, the grain of wood, the songs that keep
a joint from splitting.” He nodded toward his anvil. “Now I make
nails.”</p>
<p>“But you make keys, too,” I said, looking at the shelf.</p>
<p>He followed my gaze. A shadow passed over his face. “I make the
shapes of keys. For practice. For the memory in my hands. They open
nothing here.”</p>
<p>“There is a gate,” I said. “With three locks. One needs a key. A
large one.”</p>
<p>He was very still. The only movement was the pulse of the firelight
on his massive arms. “The gate,” he said, the word heavy with
finality.</p>
<p>“You know it.”</p>
<p>“Everyone knows it. It is the final test. The joke.” He pulled the
glowing metal from the fire with tongs. It was a rod, ready to be
shaped. “The highest lock is a Warden’s lock. The middle lock is a
Scholar’s lock. The lowest lock is a Maker’s lock. One for each kind of
broken thing they put here. You would need three of us, perfectly
coordinated, to open it. And even if you did, the guards on the wall
would cut you down before you took three steps outside.”</p>
<p>He placed the rod on the anvil and raised his hammer. But he did not
strike. He looked at me. “Three broken keys, acting as one. Have you
ever seen such a thing here? The chain-dragger? The star-chart woman?
Alaric with his numbers? We are broken <em>apart</em>. Not
together.”</p>
<p>“What if we could be?” The question left my mouth before I thought
it.</p>
<p>He brought the hammer down. <em>THUMP</em>. The sound was definitive,
final. “We can’t.”</p>
<p>“You make keys,” I pressed. “You could make that key. The one for the
gate.”</p>
<p>“I could forge the shape,” he corrected. “But the template is in my
head. The memory of the original. And my memory is… flawed. That is why
I am here. I built a box that sang the wrong song. It opened for the
wrong people. The key I make might look right. It might feel right. But
it would not turn. A flawed maker makes flawed keys.”</p>
<p>He returned the metal to the fire. The conversation was over.</p>
<p>I looked around his forge. It was the only place in the entire ruin
that felt like a purpose, not a pathology. Here was heat, creation, a
resistance that was physical and knowable. This was his anchor. Not a
turnip field, not a ledger. An anvil.</p>
<p>“What is your name?” I asked.</p>
<p>He glanced at me, as if the question was peculiar. “Barth,” he said.
Then, after a moment: “It means ‘son of the earth’ in some old tongue.
Or ‘son of sorrow.’ I forget which.”</p>
<p>“I am Emeric.”</p>
<p>“I don’t care,” he said, not unkindly. It was a statement of fact.
Names were not part of his material world.</p>
<p>I left him to his hammering. The rhythmic <em>thump</em> followed me
back into the cold ruins, a heartbeat for the prison.</p>
<p>I walked without direction, Alaric’s cold logic and Barth’s hot
resignation warring inside me. The gate was a joke. A test designed for
failure. It required three kinds of knowledge, held by three broken
minds that could not cooperate. It was the archivist’s final, elegant
lesson: <em>See? You cannot even work together to escape. You are truly,
irreparably flawed.</em></p>
<p>The moon was descending. The darkness in the east was softening to a
thin, miserable grey. Dawn was coming. With it, the patrols might
change. They might look inward. They might do a count of their broken
keys.</p>
<p>I found myself back at the cloister. The man with the chain was still
there, still walking his circle. His lips were moving faster now, a
silent, desperate litany. The woman with the sticks was asleep, curled
around her tiny, perfect fortress.</p>
<p>I watched them. The broken keys. Flawed instruments.</p>
<p>My hands were cold. I shoved them into the pockets of my cloak. My
right hand closed around the one thing I had brought from the world
before: the smooth, flat stone from the turnip field. My anchor to
Emeric.</p>
<p>I pulled it out. In the weak light, it was just a grey pebble.
Unremarkable. It had no function. It opened nothing. It was just a thing
I had picked up because it felt good in my hand.</p>
<p>A memory surfaced. Not a Warden’s memory. Emeric’s. A simple, stupid
memory. Baldric, my potato-faced brother-in-law, throwing a clod of
earth at me for daydreaming. It had hit me in the chest. I had picked up
a stone like this, not to throw, but to hold. To feel its solid,
undeniable reality. <em>This is here. I am here.</em></p>
<p>It was a memory of being present. Of being in a place, however
miserable.</p>
<p>I looked at the chain-dragger. He was not present. He was somewhere
else, walking a different circle, in a different time. I looked toward
the tower, where Barth’s hammer had finally fallen silent. He was
present only at his anvil. I thought of Alaric, in his dark chapel,
present only in his numbers.</p>
<p>And I was here, holding a stone, divided between a field and a
mechanism.</p>
<p>The archivist’s design was perfect. It did not just wall us in. It
walled us <em>off</em>. From each other. From ourselves.</p>
<p>But a wall that perfect… it had to have a flaw. Every lock did.</p>
<p>The hook for the next turn of the mechanism was not in the gate. It
was not in the Warden’s memory, or the Maker’s skill, or the Scholar’s
pattern.</p>
<p>It was in the division itself.</p>
<p>The flaw was that we were all broken in different ways. We were
different kinds of keys. And a lock that requires three different keys…
that is a lock that can only be opened by three different keys
<em>acting as one</em>.</p>
<p>It was impossible. It was the joke.</p>
<p>But a joke is just a truth turned sideways to show its absurdity.</p>
<p>The truth was: I was two things. A man and a Warden. I was a
division. And if I could be two things in one mind, however painfully…
then perhaps three minds could be one purpose.</p>
<p>It was not a plan. It was a madness. A different kind of madness than
the one offered here.</p>
<p>I looked at the stone in my hand. Then I looked at the chain-dragger,
completing another pointless circuit.</p>
<p>I did not need to make him whole. I did not need to fix his break. I
just needed his loop. I needed the star-chart woman’s pattern. I needed
Barth’s hand, and Alaric’s cold knowledge of the guards’ routines.</p>
<p>I needed to be the strange, flawed key that turned them all.</p>
<p>The grey light grew stronger. On the wall, a patrol lantern paused at
the furthest point of its circuit. It was a tiny, watchful eye, scanning
the ruins as the world woke into shadow.</p>
<p>I closed my fingers around the stone. It was solid. It was real.</p>
<p>It was time to stop being a label on a shelf. It was time to be a
key. Not a perfect one. A broken one. The kind that, by being broken in
just the right way, might fit a lock that was never meant to be
opened.</p>
<p>I stood up. The chain-dragger passed by, his eyes empty moons.</p>
<p>I would start with him.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-20">Chapter 20</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-20-1"><strong>CHAPTER 20</strong></h2>
<p>The chain-dragger’s circuit was a perfect, grinding ellipse. He began
at the stump of a broken column, shuffled along the worn path through
frost-rimed nettles, dragged his iron links past the spot where the
star-chart woman scratched her numbers, and returned to the column. His
eyes were not empty, I decided. They were full of a single, repeating
image, played so often it had worn out the screen behind them. He was a
scroll stuck in a reader. A bell with one, eternal note.</p>
<p>I fell into step beside him. The sound was our conversation: the
crunch of his feet, the dry scrape of chain, the crunch of mine. He did
not look at me. His breath plumed in the same short bursts, timed to his
steps. In, step, drag. Out, step, drag.</p>
<p>“The rent is due to Sir Guy on Thursday,” I said.</p>
<p>His rhythm did not falter. The words meant nothing. They were sounds.
I had not expected them to mean anything. I was testing the walls of his
cell. I was listening for an echo.</p>
<p>We completed a circuit. The patrol lantern on the wall had moved on,
a slow, mechanical sweep. I matched my breathing to his. In, step, drag.
Out, step, drag. My own mind wanted to wander, to skitter off to
Baldric’s turnip field, to the cold feel of the wooden spade. I pushed
it down. I was not here to remember. I was here to borrow.</p>
<p>On the third circuit, I spoke again. “You’re as useful as a hole in a
bucket.”</p>
<p>A flicker. A stutter in his step so slight it was almost a stumble on
flat ground. His head tilted, a degree. Not toward me. Toward some
internal noise my words had bumped against.</p>
<p>It was a hook. A tiny, rusted hook.</p>
<p>I did not press it. I walked. The grey light settled into the dull,
permanent overcast of the archive’s day. The star-chart woman was at her
wall, her finger tracing a line only she could see. Barth was a lump
near the gate, conserving heat. Alaric was a shadow in the lee of the
well-house, watching the guards. We were a collection of broken clocks,
each ticking a different, wrong time.</p>
<p>The chain-dragger completed his loop. I stayed with him.</p>
<p>“A hole in a bucket,” I murmured, on the next pass.</p>
<p>This time, his lips moved. No sound came out. But the shape was
clear. <em>Useless.</em></p>
<p>“Yes,” I said, the word a soft agreement. “Quite useless.”</p>
<p>He stopped. He did not look at me. He looked at his feet, at the
chain pooled in the dirt like a dead iron snake. “The water runs out,”
he said. His voice was the sound of a gate hinge that hadn’t moved in
years.</p>
<p>“It does,” I said. “No matter how much you carry.”</p>
<p>He nodded, a slow, ponderous movement. “You carry and carry. And it
runs out.” He looked up, not at me, but at the wall ahead. His eyes were
still moons, but now there was a crack in the glaze, a hairline fracture
of pure, weary frustration. “They keep giving you the bucket. They keep
pointing to the well. You go to the well. You fill it. You carry it
back. It’s empty. They point to the well.”</p>
<p>It was his loop. Not the physical one. The one inside. The memory
that had him on a tether. A task without end, without purpose, without
achievement. A joke where the punchline was your own exhaustion.</p>
<p>“What if,” I said, picking my words like stones from a muddy stream,
“you didn’t go to the well?”</p>
<p>He blinked. The concept did not fit. It was a shape his mind could
not hold. “You have to go to the well. The bucket is empty.”</p>
<p>“But the bucket has a hole.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“So the well is not the problem.”</p>
<p>He stood there, chain heavy in his hands. The conflict was a physical
strain on his face. The logic was a mouse trapped in a bell jar. “The
bucket… is the problem.”</p>
<p>“Maybe,” I said. “Or maybe the hole is the point.”</p>
<p>I left him there. To push further would be to break the hook. He
needed to circle that new, impossible thought, to drag it around his
circuit until it wore a path. I moved away, feeling the strange, hollow
weight of being a key. I had not turned him. I had inserted myself into
his mechanism. Now I had to do it again, with a different kind of
break.</p>
<p>The star-chart woman was easier to find and harder to reach. Her
world was all pattern, no people. She hummed as she worked, a tuneless,
rhythmic vibration. Up close, her chart was not stars. It was a vast,
interlocking web of numbers and symbols, mapping the patrol rotations,
the meal deliveries, the sleep cycles of the guards, the growth of the
nettles, the frequency of the chain-dragger’s circuits. It was a
madman’s attempt to find the equation for this place. To reduce the
chaos to a solvable sum.</p>
<p>I stood beside her, watching her finger move. She did not acknowledge
me. I was a variable she had not yet assigned a value.</p>
<p>“The sequence is off,” I said quietly.</p>
<p>Her finger stopped. Her humming ceased. The silence was abrupt,
violent.</p>
<p>“It is not,” she said. Her voice was crisp, dry paper. “The variance
is within acceptable parameters for a closed system with seven primary
actors and eighteen observable environmental cycles.”</p>
<p>“The new guard,” I said. “The one with the limp. He alters the third
patrol’s return interval by an average of seventeen seconds. It throws
the meal delivery prediction off by a factor of point-oh-three. It’s a
flaw in the pattern.”</p>
<p>She turned her head. Her eyes were sharp, clear, and utterly focused
on a point just past my left ear. I was not a person. I was a data point
that had spoken. “Seventeen seconds is accounted for in the subsidiary
rhythm of the wind’s influence on the gate lantern. It is not a flaw. It
is a harmonic.”</p>
<p>“But if the wind drops,” I said, “the harmonic collapses. The pattern
frays. You’ve based your prime sequence on a variable. That’s a
risk.”</p>
<p>A flicker of something like anxiety crossed her face. It was the look
of a scholar who has found a contradiction in her life’s work. “The wind
does not drop. It is a constant. I have logged four hundred and
thirty-two days of it.”</p>
<p>“Everything drops,” I said, echoing the chain-dragger’s truth.
“Eventually. A system this perfect… it’s waiting for one thing to break.
Then the whole pattern is just… marks on a wall.”</p>
<p>She stared at her wall, at the beautiful, terrifying logic of it. Her
prison was not a field or a bucket. It was the exquisite, unsolvable
puzzle she had built to keep herself sane. To suggest it was flawed was
to kick the crutch out from under her.</p>
<p>“What is your proposal?” she asked, her voice now very small.</p>
<p>“Don’t fix the pattern,” I said. “Use the break. The seventeen-second
gap. When the limping guard is at his furthest point, and the wind is in
its low phase. That’s not a flaw. That’s a door. But a door in a pattern
needs a key that isn’t in the sequence. A random element.”</p>
<p>“An anomaly,” she whispered, horrified and fascinated.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“You are an anomaly.”</p>
<p>“I am.”</p>
<p>She turned fully to me now, her eyes finally seeing my face, not my
data. She saw the division. The man and the Warden. The broken key.
“What is your function?”</p>
<p>“To turn,” I said. “With your pattern. With his loop.” I nodded
toward the chain-dragger, who was standing motionless, staring at his
hands as if seeing them for the first time. “With Barth’s strength and
Alaric’s knowledge. Three keys. One turn.”</p>
<p>“Impossible,” she said, automatically. Then she looked at her wall,
at the beautiful, fragile equation. “A three-key lock… it’s an
absurdity.”</p>
<p>“A joke,” I agreed. “But the truth is often absurd. That’s why we
lock it away.”</p>
<p>She was silent for a long time, her fingers twitching as she ran
calculations only she could see. Finally, she gave a single, sharp nod.
“The optimal anomaly insertion point is in forty-seven hours. During the
second meal. The wind will be low. The lame guard will be on the western
wall. The gap will be twenty-two seconds, not seventeen. My pattern
predicts it.”</p>
<p>“Good,” I said. “Tell Alaric the timing. He’ll need to know where the
guards are looking.”</p>
<p>“He does not speak to me. He thinks my numbers are noise.”</p>
<p>“Then write it in the dirt where he walks. He’ll see it. He sees
everything.”</p>
<p>I left her to her calculations, her pattern now infected with a
purposeful flaw. My head was a tavern of other people’s madness. The
bucket. The equation. I needed the third key: the practical one. The one
made of fear and muscle.</p>
<p>Barth was the hardest. His break was not a loop or a pattern. It was
a silence. A withdrawal so complete it was a form of vanishing. He sat
with his back to the gate, a mound of resigned flesh. He had been the
Maker. His hands had built things. Now they were folded in his lap,
useless. He had tried to fix the gate, to make a tool, to <em>do</em>
something. The archive had shown him the futility. It had broken his
will by showing him the perfect, unassailable nature of his cage. His
prison was the incontrovertible fact of the wall.</p>
<p>I sat beside him, not too close. We watched the gate. The iron, the
lock, the sheer, stupid there-ness of it.</p>
<p>“Baldric had a bucket with a hole,” I said, conversationally. “He
used to patch it with tar and straw. It would hold for a week, then the
water would find a new way out. He’d patch it again. He said it was the
principle. A bucket should hold water. That was its job.”</p>
<p>Barth said nothing. His breath clouded the air.</p>
<p>“I used to think he was a fool,” I said. “Wasting tar on a doomed
thing. But now I think… maybe the patching was the point. Not the
bucket. The act of repair. The defiance of the hole.”</p>
<p>Barth’s hands, resting on his knees, tightened slightly. Knuckles
white.</p>
<p>“This place,” I said, gesturing to the wall, the ruins, the whole
grey mechanism, “it’s a bucket with a perfect hole. It’s designed to let
everything we are run out. Our names. Our memories. Our will. It’s very
good at it.”</p>
<p>I picked up a small, flat stone. I turned it over in my fingers. “But
a perfect hole… it has perfect edges. Precise. Predictable.” I held the
stone up, aligning it with a seam in the gate’s iron plating. “A thing
that is precise can be measured. A thing that can be measured…” I let
the implication hang.</p>
<p>“Can be matched,” Barth said, his voice a gravelly avalanche from the
depths of him. He did not look at me. He looked at the gate. “You can’t
match that. You have no tools. No forge. No time.”</p>
<p>“I don’t need to match the gate,” I said. “I need to match the lock.
And I don’t need to make a key. I <em>am</em> a key. We all are. Broken
pieces. But the lock is broken too. It needs three broken pieces, turned
together, at the right moment.”</p>
<p>“Madness,” he grunted.</p>
<p>“Yes. A different kind. Will you listen to it?”</p>
<p>I told him. I told him of the chain-dragger’s loop, now wobbling on
its axis. Of the star-chart woman’s pattern, with a twenty-two second
anomaly woven into its heart. Of Alaric’s cold knowledge of blind spots
and guard-counts. And I told him what I needed from him. Not to build.
Not to forge. To break. At the precise moment, in the precise place.</p>
<p>When I finished, he was still looking at the gate. But his eyes were
different. They were not seeing an immovable object. They were seeing a
problem. A thing with dimensions, weight, stress points. A thing that
could, theoretically, be acted upon.</p>
<p>“The hinge on the inside,” he said, finally. “The upper pivot. It’s
worn. It groans when the night damp gets into it. A concentrated force
there, at the right angle, with the gate’s own weight moving… it
wouldn’t break. But it would bind. It would stick for a count of ten.
Maybe fifteen.”</p>
<p>“How much force?”</p>
<p>He looked at his hands. Then at the chain-dragger’s chain, lying in
the dirt. Then at a particular, thick-rooted nettle patch near the wall.
“Enough,” he said. “If I have a lever. And a fulcrum. And a
distraction.”</p>
<p>“You’ll have a distraction,” I said.</p>
<p>He nodded, once. The Maker was back, in the ruins of the man. He had
a problem to solve. A patch to apply. The principle of the thing.</p>
<p>The final piece was Alaric. He found me. I was back at my starting
point, watching the patrols, feeling the stone in my hand. He melted
from the shadow of the well-house and stood beside me, his gaze on the
walls.</p>
<p>“The woman is scribbling numbers by the latrine ditch,” he said, his
tone flat. “A sequence. With a time.”</p>
<p>“Do you understand it?”</p>
<p>“It’s a guard gap. Western wall. Second meal, tomorrow. Twenty-two
seconds. It’s the best one. Not the longest, but the one where the eyes
are farthest away. They’re watching the kitchen vent, hoping for
scraps.”</p>
<p>“Will it work?”</p>
<p>“It’s a window,” he said. “A window isn’t a door. What happens in the
window?”</p>
<p>“Barth binds the inner hinge. The gate sticks. The chain-dragger
begins his circuit from a new point—the gate itself. He will be…
agitated. He will draw the eye. You and I go through the window. Not
out. In. To the archive tower.”</p>
<p>Alaric was silent for a long time. The risk was absolute. Capture
meant more than punishment. It meant un-making. A deeper shelving.</p>
<p>“Why?” he asked. Not why attempt it. Why the tower.</p>
<p>“The archivist’s design is perfect because it uses our breaks against
us. It turns us into labels. But he has to read the labels. He has to
know where everything is. There’s a ledger. A master list. Not of what
we are, but of what we <em>were</em>. Our names, our trades, our…
original hooks. It’s in the tower. If we can find it… we don’t just
escape a yard. We change the classification.”</p>
<p>“You want to re-shelf us,” Alaric said, understanding dawning like a
cold, grey dawn.</p>
<p>“I want to break the index,” I said. “A book without an index is just
paper. A prison without a ledger is just a place. They could hunt us,
but they wouldn’t know what they were hunting. We’d be anomalies in
their own system.”</p>
<p>Alaric almost smiled. It was a thin, grim crack in his face.
“Chaos.”</p>
<p>“A different kind of order,” I corrected. “One they didn’t
write.”</p>
<p>He gave a slow nod. “I will be at the window. Do not be late.”</p>
<p>The plan was set. It was not a plan. It was a hypothesis. A joke
waiting to be told. We were the punchline, or we were the truth it
revealed.</p>
<p>The forty-seven hours were a slow, tight coil of tension. The
chain-dragger walked his loop, but now he sometimes paused, looking at
the bucket by the well-house with a strange, speculative hatred. The
star-chart woman scratched new, frantic calculations, her anomaly now
the central node of her web. Barth sat by a particular stone, his
fingers tracing invisible stress diagrams in the air. Alaric became a
ghost, visible only as a slight disturbance in the routine of the
guards, a shadow that was always where a guard had just looked away.</p>
<p>I held my stone. I felt the division inside me—the Warden’s cold
calculus, the man’s muddy, turnip-field fear—and I did not try to mend
it. I let the crack be. It was the edge I would turn on.</p>
<p>The second meal arrived. The wind, as predicted, dropped to a sigh.
The sky was the colour of old lead. The guards on the wall were
sluggish, their attention on the steaming pot being carried into the
yard. The lame guard began his slow trek along the western parapet.</p>
<p>My heart was not a drum. It was a stone in my chest. A cold, solid
thing.</p>
<p>I caught the chain-dragger’s eye as he began his circuit. I pointed
to the gate. Not to the well. To the gate. He frowned, the weight of his
bucket-less hands confusing him. Then he looked at the gate. He saw the
iron. He saw the hole where all things ran out. A new, slow anger heated
the moons of his eyes. He changed his course. He began shuffling
directly toward the great iron doors, his chain dragging a new, defiant
furrow in the dirt.</p>
<p>It was time.</p>
<p>I moved. Alaric was a smear in the grey light, already at the base of
the western wall, beneath the blind spot. Barth had vanished. I saw the
chain, looped around the thick nettle root, running taut to a lever—a
piece of broken timber—wedged under a stone. Barth’s weight was on the
other end, a human counterweight, waiting.</p>
<p>The star-chart woman stood by her wall, her hand over a specific
number. Her eyes were closed. She was counting.</p>
<p>The lame guard reached the furthest point of his beat. He turned his
back, looking inward, yawning.</p>
<p>The woman’s hand slapped the wall.</p>
<p>Barth threw his weight down.</p>
<p>The chain snapped taut. The lever groaned. At the gate, there was a
deep, metallic shriek—the sound of a giant’s toothache. The right-hand
door, swinging inward for the meal delivery, juddered. It stuck. The
guard pushing it cursed, shoving against it. It did not move.</p>
<p>All eyes turned to the gate. The commotion. The stuck door.</p>
<p>The chain-dragger reached the gate. He stared at the stuck hinge, at
the shouting guard. He lifted his hands, the chains dangling. “The
hole,” he boomed, his voice startlingly loud. “THE HOLE IS HERE!”</p>
<p>He began beating his chains against the iron door, a furious,
clanging dissonance. It was the perfect distraction. A madman having a
fit at a malfunction. Every guard on the wall focused on him, some
laughing, some shouting orders.</p>
<p>Alaric was already moving, a spider up the rough stone. I followed,
my fingers finding cracks I had memorized from a distance. The
twenty-two seconds began.</p>
<p>We climbed. The stone was cold, gritty. My breath burned. Below, the
cacophony of the chain-dragger’s protest and the guards’ annoyance was a
blanket of noise covering our scrape and scuffle.</p>
<p>We reached the parapet. Alaric slithered over, flat to the walkway. I
followed. We were on the wall. The archive tower was a dark finger
against the grey sky, thirty paces to our left, past a guard post now
empty, its occupant drawn to the spectacle at the gate.</p>
<p>We ran, not crouched, but upright, moving with the swift, silent
purpose of men who belonged there. Alaric’s knowledge was our map. We
reached a low door of black oak, set in the tower’s base. It was
locked.</p>
<p>Alaric produced a thin, bent piece of metal from his sleeve. A shard
of a spoon, worn smooth. He worked it into the lock. His hands were
steady. The world had narrowed to this mechanism, this tiny, physical
problem.</p>
<p>At the gate, the noise changed. A sharper shout. The sound of a blow.
The chain-dragger’s clanging stopped with a choked cry.</p>
<p>They were restoring order. Time was bleeding out.</p>
<p>The lock clicked.</p>
<p>Alaric pushed the door open. A rush of cold, still air smelling of
dust and old paper greeted us. Darkness.</p>
<p>We slipped inside. Alaric closed the door softly behind us. The
sounds of the yard became muffled, distant.</p>
<p>We were in a narrow stairwell, spiraling up into blackness. Somewhere
above, the ledger waited. The index of our souls.</p>
<p>But as my eyes adjusted, I saw we were not alone at the foot of the
stairs. A figure stood there, holding a single, guttering candle. It was
the old guard, the one who always watched the gate. His eyes were not
surprised. They were weary. He had been waiting.</p>
<p>“The archivist,” he said, his voice echoing softly in the stone tube,
“knows a joke requires an audience. He wondered when you’d come inside
to tell it.”</p>
<p>He raised the candle, illuminating the stairway behind him. Standing
on the steps, silent and still as statues, were four other guards. Their
clubs were in their hands.</p>
<p>The window was closed. The joke, it seemed, was on us.</p>
<p>But a joke is just a truth turned sideways. And the truth was, we
were inside. And sometimes, the only way out of a perfect lock is to go
deeper into its mechanism.</p>
<p>I tightened my grip on my stone. The punchline wasn’t over yet.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-21">Chapter 21</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-21-1"><strong>CHAPTER 21</strong></h2>
<p>The candlelight carved hollows under the old guard’s eyes. He looked
less like a man and more like a piece of the tower’s furniture, worn
smooth by the passage of clerks and secrets. His name was Hodge. I knew
this the way I knew the taste of turnip—a fact that surfaced without its
context, a bone dredged from a murky pond. He had a grandson with a
crooked smile who brought him a meat pie on Saints’ days.</p>
<p>This knowledge was useless. It was also a trap. A memory is a hook in
the flesh, and sentiment is the line. Hodge’s weary gaze was a
fisherman’s.</p>
<p>Alaric let the shard of spoon fall silently into his palm, a silver
fish scale. “An audience implies a performance,” he said, his voice low
and even in the stone throat of the stairwell. “We’re just here for a
book.”</p>
<p>“A book,” Hodge repeated. The word was dry as a pressed leaf. “The
only book. The one that writes you, not the other way around.” He
shifted the candle. The light licked over the faces of the four guards
on the stairs behind him. They were younger, their weariness a different
brand—the simmering, bored kind that craises violence to pass the time.
Their clubs were not for show. They were worn smooth at the grips.</p>
<p>The air in the stairwell was a closed fist. The distant chaos from
the yard was a dream of noise. Here, there was only the smell of cold
stone, tallow smoke, and the sharp scent of waiting sweat.</p>
<p>I held the river stone in my hand. Its weight was a fact. <em>I am
holding a stone.</em> A simpler truth than <em>I am Emeric</em>. The
stone did not misplace itself. It was a perfect, dense answer to a
question that had not yet been asked.</p>
<p>“The archivist’s joke,” I said. My voice sounded like someone else’s,
someone calmer than the thing rattling in my chest. “The setup is a
locked tower. The punchline is five guards at the bottom of the only
stairs.”</p>
<p>Hodge’s mouth twitched. It wasn’t a smile. It was the ghost of one, a
ripple on a still pond. “The punchline,” he corrected softly, “is that
you walked into the setup knowing it was a joke. That’s the funny
part.”</p>
<p>He was right. A joke is a truth turned sideways. The truth was,
Alaric had suspected a trap. The archivist was a spider, and his web was
made of ledgers and loopholes. We had seen the strands. We had chosen to
touch them anyway, because the only other choice was to stand outside in
the yard and be written out of the story by Sir Guy’s men. We had chosen
the mechanism of the lock.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the only way out is deeper in.</p>
<p>Alaric moved first. He did not move toward the guards. He moved
toward the wall, his hand brushing the stones as if reading them. “The
index is upstairs,” he said, not to Hodge, but to me. As if we were
continuing a private conversation. “The archivist’s chambers are on the
second landing. He’ll be there. He wouldn’t miss the punchline.”</p>
<p>This was the plan, the one we had knitted together in hushed
fragments on the filthy floor of the tannery. The diversion at the gate
was the first stitch. This was the second. Alaric would go for the
archivist. The man who held the pen was the true lock. I was to go for
the ledger. A splitting of forces. A desperate man’s arithmetic.</p>
<p>The guards saw the division in our stances. Their boredom
crystallized into purpose. Two of them stepped down, clubs rising,
aiming to bracket Alaric against the wall.</p>
<p>Hodge just watched, his candle steady. “He’s not there,” he said,
almost apologetically. “He’s upstairs. With the book.”</p>
<p>It was a wrench in the mechanism. Alaric’s calculation, so clean, so
logical, stuttered. If the archivist was with the ledger, then the
ledger was guarded by more than parchment and ink. It was guarded by the
author himself.</p>
<p>The moment of stutter was all the guards needed. The first club came
whistling down at Alaric’s head. He slid along the wall, the club
sparking against stone where his skull had been. The second guard lunged
at me, a straightforward, brutal thrust of the club aimed at my gut.</p>
<p>I did not think. My body remembered something my mind did not. I
turned sideways, the club grazing my ribs with a thud that stole my
breath, and I brought the river stone up in a short, hard arc. It
connected with the guard’s elbow. There was a wet, cracking sound, like
stepping on a rotten branch. He screamed, a high, shocked sound in the
confined space, and his club clattered to the steps.</p>
<p>The sound of the scream changed everything. It made it real. It made
it messy.</p>
<p>The other two guards on the stairs roared and charged down. Hodge did
not move. He raised his candle higher, illuminating the chaos, a silent
stage manager.</p>
<p>Alaric had drawn his own weapon—not a knife, but a heavy leather sap
filled with sand. It was a quiet weapon, a thudding weapon. He caught a
descending wrist with his free hand and brought the sap down on it. The
guard grunted, his fingers splaying open. Alaric drove a knee into his
belly and shoved him back into his companion.</p>
<p>They became a tangle of limbs and curses on the narrow steps. The
guard I’d hit was on his knees, cradling his arm, his face white with
pain. But the first guard, the one who’d missed Alaric, was coming at me
again, his eyes black with fury.</p>
<p>I had the stone. He had the club and the reach. He feinted high, then
swung low at my knees. I jumped back, my heel catching on the bottom
step. I stumbled, arms wheeling. The guard pressed his advantage,
raising the club for a final, crushing blow.</p>
<p>A shadow detached itself from the wall behind him. It was Alaric. He
moved like smoke, wrapping an arm around the guard’s neck, pulling him
back and down. The guard’s eyes bulged. The club fell from his grip. He
clawed at Alaric’s arm, his boots scraping on the stone floor. Alaric
held him, tight and impersonal, until the struggles grew weak, then
ceased. He let the body slump to the ground.</p>
<p>The tangle on the stairs had resolved itself. One guard was
unconscious, his head at a bad angle against a step. The other was
holding his throat, gashing for air through a crushed windpipe. The one
with the broken arm was sobbing quietly.</p>
<p>It had taken less than a minute. The stairwell was now a pocket of
panting breath and pain.</p>
<p>Hodge had not moved. The candle in his hand guttered, a long tongue
of wax curling down its side. He looked at the ruin of his men, then at
us. His weariness had deepened into a profound, unshakeable sadness.</p>
<p>“You see?” he said. “The joke. You’re the violence in the quiet
place. The stain on the page. He knew you would be.”</p>
<p>“Where is he?” Alaric’s voice was a rasp. The sap hung from his hand,
dark with sweat.</p>
<p>“Third landing,” Hodge said. He nodded upward, into the darkness.
“The Reading Room. He’s waiting. He has the book open.” He finally
lowered the candle. “My part is done. I was the usher. I showed you to
your seats.”</p>
<p>He stepped aside, pressing his back against the curving wall, making
room for us to pass. He was an old man, doing his job. The morality of
it was a ledger entry he did not control.</p>
<p>Alaric and I exchanged a glance. The hook was baited and set. The
archivist was upstairs, with the ledger, inviting us in. It was a better
trap than five guards. It was a trap made of our own need.</p>
<p>We went up.</p>
<p>The stairs were tight and steep, coiling around a central stone
pillar. Our footsteps were swallowed by the mossy treads. The light from
Hodge’s candle faded below, leaving us in a darkness that was almost
total. We moved by touch and by memory—Alaric’s memory of the tower’s
layout, stolen from a drunk clerk months ago.</p>
<p>The second landing was a small, square space. A door of latticed iron
stood open. Beyond it was a room lined with shelves, stacked not with
books but with boxes—metal deed boxes, wooden crates. The archivist’s
chambers. Empty, as Hodge had said. A desk held a neat stack of paper,
an inkpot, a row of pristine quills. It was a stage set, waiting for its
actor to return.</p>
<p>We did not stop.</p>
<p>The third landing was different. A soft, buttery light seeped from
under a heavy door of polished oak. No iron lattice here. This was the
inner sanctum. The Reading Room.</p>
<p>There was no sound from within.</p>
<p>Alaric put his hand on the iron ring of the door. He looked at me. In
the faint light, his face was all planes and shadows, a map of a harsh
country. He gave a single, sharp nod.</p>
<p>We went in.</p>
<p>The room was not large, but its height gave it a cathedral feel.
Shelves rose into the gloom, packed with ledgers, scrolls, folios bound
in cracked leather. They were the supporting volumes, the chorus to the
soloist. In the center of the room, under a pool of light from a single,
large lantern on a chain, was a broad table of dark wood.</p>
<p>And at the table sat the archivist.</p>
<p>He was a small man, neat as a pin. His hair was grey and fine,
receded from a high, thoughtful forehead. He wore a dark robe, not
unlike a scholar’s, but of a finer, darker wool. He looked up as we
entered, his eyes magnified by a pair of wire-rimmed spectacles perched
on his nose. He did not look alarmed. He looked interested.</p>
<p>On the table before him lay an enormous ledger. Its cover was of
aged, mottled leather, the spine thick as a man’s wrist. It was open.
The pages were creamy vellum, covered in dense, meticulous script. The
ink was a severe black.</p>
<p>“Emeric,” the archivist said. His voice was pleasant, mid-range, the
voice of a man who explains things for a living. “And Alaric. I’ve just
been reading about you. Please, come in. Close the door. The draft plays
havoc with the pages.”</p>
<p>I closed the door. The sound of the latch engaging was terribly
final. We were in a sealed box with the man who held our
definitions.</p>
<p>“You’re not surprised,” Alaric said. He stayed by the door, a
sentinel in the shadows.</p>
<p>“Surprise is a function of poor information,” the archivist replied.
He closed the ledger gently, placing a velvet-weighted ribbon to mark
the place. His hands were clean, the nails perfectly trimmed. “I have
excellent information. I know the rent due on Baldric’s turnip field. I
know the weight of the silver Sir Guy expects. I know the exact number
of nails in the shoes of the horse you sold to the carter from Lindon. I
know you dream of a river, Emeric. One with a grey, slow current. And
you, Alaric… you dream of a door. A red door, in a white wall. You’ve
never seen it, but you dream of it all the same.”</p>
<p>A cold finger traced my spine. The river. I had never spoken of
it.</p>
<p>“This book,” I said. My voice was rough. “It has our memories.”</p>
<p>“Oh, no,” the archivist said, smiling faintly. He removed his
spectacles and began to polish them on a corner of his robe. “It has the
facts. Memories are what you build from the facts. Unreliable,
subjective, messy. The facts are clean. You were born in the parish of
St. Eloy’s, to one Marta, a washerwoman. The father is listed as
unknown. You were apprenticed to a cooper at age seven. You ran away at
age twelve. You were caught stealing a loaf of bread from Sir Guy’s
kitchens at age fifteen. You were given the choice of the gaol or the
lease on Baldric’s field. You chose the field. You married Baldric’s
sister, Elara, two years later. She died in childbirth the following
spring. The child, a girl, was stillborn.” He put his spectacles back
on. “Those are the facts. Your memory of Elara’s smile… that is yours.
The book does not traffic in smiles.”</p>
<p>Each fact was a stone dropped into the well of me. They sank, and I
waited for the splash, for the feeling of recognition. It did not come.
They were just stones. Data. A list of events that might have happened
to anyone.</p>
<p>“Why?” Alaric asked. The word was stripped bare.</p>
<p>“Why keep the book?” The archivist spread his hands, indicating the
room, the shelves, the order of it all. “Control. A man is a story he
tells himself. But if you hold the source material, you can edit the
story. You can remind a man he is a thief when he dreams of being a
hero. You can remind him he is a tenant when he dreams of owning land.
You can remind him he is alone when he dreams of kinship. It is a gentle
control. It requires no chains, no dungeons. Just the occasional…
consultation.”</p>
<p>“You consult with Sir Guy,” I said.</p>
<p>“I provide clarity,” the archivist corrected. “Sir Guy understands
that people are their records. He is a practical man. He wishes to
manage his assets. I am the keeper of the ledger. We have an
understanding.”</p>
<p>“And our understanding?” Alaric took a step forward, into the edge of
the lantern light. “We’re here to burn it.”</p>
<p>The archivist’s smile did not waver, but it cooled, like a pot pulled
from the fire. “That would be a tragedy. Not for Sir Guy. He has copies
of the pertinent entries—debts, holdings, infractions. The
administrative facts. No, the tragedy would be for you.” He leaned
forward, his eyes intent. “This book, this master ledger, it doesn’t
just list you. In a way, it <em>contains</em> you. The facts are the
scaffolding. Without them… what are you? A man with a head full of
whispers and river-dreams. A ghost. Burning this book wouldn’t free you.
It would unmake you.”</p>
<p>He was good. His words were needles, seeking the seams in my
certainty. <em>A clerical error in the soul.</em> Was this the ledger
where the error was logged?</p>
<p>“You’re lying,” I said. But it felt weak.</p>
<p>“Am I?” He opened the ledger again. He turned pages with a soft,
whispering sound. He found an entry. “Here. Alaric. Born in the mining
district of Blackstone. Mother deceased in a collapse. Father… ah. A
fascinating entry. ‘Father: designation <em>Custos</em>.’” He looked up.
“<em>Custos</em>. A keeper. A guard. Of what, it does not say. But it
explains the skills, doesn’t it? The knowledge of locks. The silence.
It’s in the blood. A fact.”</p>
<p>Alaric’s face was stone. But I saw a tiny pulse jump in his jaw.</p>
<p>The archivist turned a few more pages. “And Emeric. Let’s see… after
the entry for your wife’s death… there is an addendum. In a different
ink.” He squinted, then read aloud. “‘Subject exhibits episodic
cognitive dissonance. Observed in states of fatigue or stress. May
question foundational facts. Recommend monitored reinforcement.’” He
looked at me over the rims of his spectacles. “They knew. Even then. You
were a book with a loose binding. They’ve been quietly tightening the
screws for years.”</p>
<p>The room felt smaller. The shelves seemed to lean in. The lantern
light was a pit we stood in.</p>
<p>“Reinforcement,” I echoed. The word had a metallic taste.</p>
<p>“A conversation with Baldric. A reminder from Sir Guy’s steward. The
world itself, reflecting the facts back to you, until you accept them as
truth.” He sighed, a sound of genuine regret. “It is a kinder process
than you think. It gives you a shape. A purpose. To burn this is to
choose formlessness. Are you sure you want to be nothing?”</p>
<p>It was the perfect trap. Not one of iron, but of philosophy. To
destroy the ledger was to destroy ourselves. To accept it was to remain
prisoners of its text.</p>
<p>Alaric spoke, his voice cutting through the thick silence. “You said
it contains us.”</p>
<p>The archivist nodded. “In a literal sense, yes. The facts are the
essence.”</p>
<p>“Then if we take it,” Alaric said, taking another step, “we take
ourselves. We become our own keepers.”</p>
<p>For the first time, a flicker of unease crossed the archivist’s neat
face. “It is not a thing to be carried. It is the foundation of the
order here.”</p>
<p>“Our order is changing,” I said. The stone was still in my hand. Its
weight was a fact outside the ledger. I stepped to the table, opposite
him. “We’re taking it.”</p>
<p>“You’ll be taking a corpse,” the archivist said softly. “Your
own.”</p>
<p>“We’ll risk it.”</p>
<p>I reached for the ledger.</p>
<p>He was faster than he looked. His hand darted not for the book, but
for the lantern above it. He grabbed the chain and pulled. The lantern
swung, a sudden, wild pendulum of light and shadow. He threw something
from his robe—a handful of fine, grey powder—into the lantern’s
flame.</p>
<p>There was no explosion. Just a soft <em>whump</em>, and the room was
filled with a blinding, white smoke that smelled of salt and burnt
honey. It stung the eyes, clogged the throat.</p>
<p>I stumbled back, choking. I heard Alaric curse, heard the archivist’s
chair scrape, heard his light, quick footsteps heading not for the door,
but for the back of the room.</p>
<p>Through the swimming haze, I saw him—a grey ghost vanishing between
two high shelves. There was a passage there, a hidden way.</p>
<p>Alaric lunged after him, a shadow in the smoke.</p>
<p>I turned back to the table. The ledger. Through the white murk, it
was a dark oblong. I swept my arms across the table, found its solid
weight, and dragged it toward me. It was heavier than I imagined, a slab
of history. I clutched it to my chest, the vellum pages pressing against
me like a second, colder skin.</p>
<p>The smoke was beginning to thin, sucked upward by some draft in the
tower’s height. I heard a grunt, a thud of bodies impacting shelves from
the back of the room.</p>
<p>Then Alaric’s voice, sharp. “Emeric!”</p>
<p>I hugged the ledger and ran toward the sound, around the table,
between the towering shelves. At the rear wall, between two cases of
scrolls, was a low, open archway. A narrow, dark corridor lay
beyond.</p>
<p>Alaric was there, on one knee. The archivist lay sprawled before him,
unconscious or dead, a trickle of blood from his hairline dark against
the pale stone floor. Alaric was breathing hard.</p>
<p>“He was heading for a bell-pull,” Alaric gasped. “A silent alarm. To
the guardhouse.”</p>
<p>We listened. No bells. No shouts of alarm from below. Yet.</p>
<p>“We have to go. Now.” Alaric rose.</p>
<p>I looked down at the ledger in my arms. It was ours. It was us. The
weight of it was immense.</p>
<p>We ran back through the Reading Room, now hazy and surreal. We burst
out onto the landing and took the stairs two at a time, descending into
the deeper dark.</p>
<p>The second landing. The first. The ground floor.</p>
<p>Hodge was still there, his candle almost spent. He looked at the
ledger in my arms. His weary eyes widened, just for a second, with
something that might have been fear. Or awe.</p>
<p>He said nothing. He just pressed himself back against the wall
again.</p>
<p>We shoved open the black oak door and stumbled out into the yard.</p>
<p>The world rushed back in—the cold air, the smell of mud and horses,
the distant, fading sounds of the suppressed riot at the gate. The sky
was the color of a fresh bruise, twilight settling in.</p>
<p>We did not run. Running draws the eye. We walked, swift and
purposeful, away from the tower, toward the shadow of the stables. We
were two clerks, carrying a heavy tome. We belonged.</p>
<p>But as we reached the deeper shadows, I risked a glance back at the
archive tower. In a high window, the one from the Reading Room, a light
still burned. And standing in that window, silhouetted against the glow,
was a figure. Small, neat, one hand raised to its head.</p>
<p>The archivist. Watching us go.</p>
<p>He had let us take it.</p>
<p>The realization was a cold flood. He had fought, but not enough. He
had been between us and the bell-pull, but Alaric had reached him too
easily. He had let us take the ledger.</p>
<p><em>You’ll be taking a corpse. Your own.</em></p>
<p>Was it a warning? Or was it the final, cruel setup of the joke?</p>
<p>We had the book. We had the facts of our own lives in our hands. But
as we melted into the gathering dusk, the ledger felt less like a
treasure and more like a coffin. We were carrying our own bones. And the
man who had buried them was watching from his high window, waiting for
us to try and breathe life into them.</p>
<p>The punchline wasn’t over yet.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-22">Chapter 22</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-22-1"><strong>CHAPTER 22</strong></h2>
<p>The ledger was a cold stone against my chest. We walked, Alaric a
half-step ahead, his shoulders a tight line of purpose. The mud of the
yard sucked at our boots. The air tasted of wet wool and distant smoke.
We were two clerks. We were carrying a heavy tome. We belonged.</p>
<p>The lie was so thin it was a miracle the dusk didn’t tear it.</p>
<p>We reached the lee of the stables, where the shadows were thick as
tar. Alaric stopped, his back to the rough-hewn wall. He did not look at
me. His eyes were on the archive tower, on that single high window where
the light still burned. The silhouette was gone.</p>
<p>“He let us go,” Alaric said. His voice was flat, a statement of fact
that refused to make sense.</p>
<p>“He did.” The words were ash in my mouth. <em>You’ll be taking a
corpse. Your own.</em> The archivist’s warning was a worm in the grain
of the wood, in the pulp of the ledger’s pages. A joke you only
understand when it’s too late to stop laughing.</p>
<p>Alaric finally turned his head. In the gloom, his face was all angles
and hollows. “Why?”</p>
<p>“He’s a librarian,” I said. The answer felt true, in a way that facts
never did. “He doesn’t stop the book from being read. He just notes who
borrows it. For the record.”</p>
<p>“For the debt,” Alaric corrected. He pushed off from the wall. “We
can’t stay here. The gate’s still a mess. They’ll be locking down the
outer yard.”</p>
<p>“Where, then?”</p>
<p>He didn’t answer. He was already moving, slipping along the stable
wall toward the rear of the compound, where the workshops and
storehouses hunched against the curtain wall. I followed, the ledger’s
weight a clumsy counterbalance to my steps. It was our bones. Our
coffin. We were pallbearers at our own funeral, and the service had not
yet begun.</p>
<p>We passed the charcoal-smell of the smithy, dark and silent. Past the
tanner’s yard, with its vats like open graves. The world here was all
function and filth, the hidden guts of the fortress. This was where
things were made, broken, rendered down. It felt appropriate.</p>
<p>Alaric stopped at a low, squat building of wattle and daub, its
thatch rotting. A toolshed, or a granary long fallen from use. The door
was a warped thing, held shut by a loop of rope over a rusted nail. He
glanced around, a quick cut of his eyes, then slipped the rope free and
shouldered the door inward.</p>
<p>The smell that rolled out was ancient: damp grain, mouse-droppings,
the sweet-sour reek of forgotten apples. We slipped inside. Alaric
pulled the door shut behind us, and the dark became absolute, a physical
substance in our lungs.</p>
<p>A scrape. A spark. The tiny, desperate flame of a tinderbox caught on
a twist of dry straw. Alaric’s hands, steady and precise, lit a stub of
tallow candle he produced from his sleeve. The light pushed the dark
back a few feet, revealing a space crowded with broken harrows, sacks of
something lumpy and fossilized, and a dust that lay thick as
snowfall.</p>
<p>He set the candle on an upturned barrel. Then he turned to me, and
held out his hands.</p>
<p>For a moment, I didn’t understand. Then I did. I passed him the
ledger.</p>
<p>He took it as if receiving a sacrament. He laid it on the barrel
beside the candle, brushing the dust from its cover with a tenderness I
had never seen in him. The candlelight gilded the tooled leather, danced
in the grooves of the sigil—the tower, the key, the eye.</p>
<p>“Now,” he said. Not to me. To the book.</p>
<p>He opened it.</p>
<p>The crack of the spine was a gunshot in the silent dark. The pages
whispered, a dry, resentful sound. He began to turn them, his fingers
careful at the corners. Past the frontispiece, past the tables of
jurisdiction. Into the meat of the record.</p>
<p>I moved to stand beside him. The words swam in the low light. Entries
in a dozen different hands, some neat and clerical, some a frantic
scrawl. Dates. Names. Sums. Crimes. Properties seized. Services
rendered. Debts incurred. It was the mundane machinery of power, the
grinding of a mill that turned lives into notations.</p>
<p>“We won’t be in the main register,” Alaric murmured, his eyes
scanning. “Not as ourselves. We’re a sub-entry. A footnote to a larger
transaction.”</p>
<p>“How do you know?”</p>
<p>“It’s how they work.” He didn’t elaborate. His finger traced down a
column. “Here. The Disposition of Assets Following the Pacification of
the Free Company of the Ashen Dog.”</p>
<p>My breath caught. The Ashen Dog. The name was a ghost of a sound, a
vibration in a bone I didn’t remember breaking. It meant nothing. It
meant everything.</p>
<p>Alaric’s finger moved to the sub-heading. <em>Indentured Service,
Non-Combatant Personnel.</em></p>
<p>And there we were.</p>
<p>Not as names. As numbers.</p>
<p><em>Item 47: Male, adult, literate. Minor head trauma, memory
impairment. Assigned agricultural servitude, tenure of seven years, to
the estate of Sir Guy of Blackwater. See supplemental folio for
conditioning protocols.</em></p>
<p><em>Item 48: Male, adult, literate. Right hand, partial amputation of
two fingers. Assigned clerical servitude, tenure of seven years, to the
Chancery Archive of the Blackwater March. See supplemental folio for
conditioning protocols.</em></p>
<p>We were items. We were injuries and assignments. We were a
tenure.</p>
<p>I was Item 47. The head trauma. The turnip field. Baldric’s
disappointed potato face. The worn shoe of the name <em>Emeric</em>.</p>
<p>Alaric was Item 48. The missing fingers. The archive. The perfect,
empty clerk.</p>
<p>“Conditioning protocols,” I said. The words were cold pebbles.</p>
<p>Alaric’s jaw was a knot. He turned the page. The next folio was not
text. It was a diagram, inked with a cruel, clinical precision. A map of
a skull, with points labeled. Frontal lobe. Temporal. Hippocampus. Words
I shouldn’t know, but did, the knowledge rising like bile. Alongside it,
instructions. Phrasal triggers. Sensory deprivation sequences.
Nutritional supplements to enhance suggestibility. A regimen of
“contextual reinforcement” involving repetitive tasks and controlled
social isolation.</p>
<p>It was a recipe. A recipe for unmaking a man and baking a useful
shell in his place.</p>
<p>“They didn’t just take our memories,” Alaric said. His voice was a
wire stretched to singing. “They <em>installed</em> new ones. The
fields. The archive. The loyalty. They… they <em>tuned</em> us. Like a
pair of lutes.”</p>
<p>He turned another page. More entries. Other items. Other broken men,
retuned to other purposes. A blacksmith with no memory of his forge, now
a docile gate-guard. A herbalist who could no longer name a single
plant, now a chambermaid. It was a production line. The Pacification of
the Ashen Dog wasn’t a battle. It was a harvest. They harvested us for
parts, for labor, for whatever was left that could hold a spade or a
pen.</p>
<p>“Why?” The question was a child’s question, stupid and fundamental.
“Why not just kill us?”</p>
<p>Alaric’s eyes were locked on the page. “A dead man is a waste. A
repurposed man is an asset. And a man who doesn’t know he’s a prisoner
needs no bars.” He finally looked at me. The candle flame reflected in
his eyes, twin points of hellish light. “We weren’t defeated. We were
<em>processed</em>.”</p>
<p>The shed seemed to shrink, the walls pressing in, the dust-thick air
turning to soup in my throat. I had been a thing in a turnip field. A
thing that thought it was a man named Emeric, with a brother-in-law
named Baldric, and a debt to Sir Guy. A simple, sad story. A life of
dirt and debt. I had mourned that life, its smallness. Now I would have
given anything to have it back. It was a gift, that small life. A
beautiful, crafted lie.</p>
<p>“The Ashen Dog,” I said. “Who were we?”</p>
<p>Alaric turned back to the beginning of the entry, to the summary of
the “Pacification.” His lips moved as he read the dry, official
language. <em>…a notorious free company, operating beyond the northern
marches… known for banditry, insurrectionist rhetoric… eliminated by
forces under the command of Sir Guy of Blackwater, with the strategic
assistance of the Chancery’s Office of Pacification…</em></p>
<p>“Mercenaries,” I said. It didn’t fit. It felt like someone else’s
shirt.</p>
<p>“Maybe.” Alaric’s finger stopped on a phrase. “<em>Insurrectionist
rhetoric.</em>” He looked up, his gaze distant, turned inward. “A free
company. Not sworn to a lord. Operating beyond the marches. That’s not
just banditry. That’s… a choice.”</p>
<p>A memory, then. Not a true one. A ghost of one. The feeling of open
road underfoot. Of a banner, rough cloth, snapping in a wind that didn’t
smell of turnips or dust. Of a argument around a fire, voices raised not
in anger, but in passion. A idea. A <em>choice</em>.</p>
<p>It was gone as soon as it came, leaving only an ache.</p>
<p>“Sir Guy,” I said. “He didn’t just take us in out of charity. He was
the one who… who pacified us. He owns our tenure. He’s our keeper.”</p>
<p>Alaric nodded slowly. “And the archive polices the debt. The
archivist… he’s the warden of the records. He makes sure the
conditioning holds. That we don’t… remember.”</p>
<p><em>You’ll be taking a corpse.</em> The archivist hadn’t meant he
would kill us. He meant the men we were <em>were already dead</em>. We
were the corpses, animated by Chancery magic, carrying our own graves in
our heads.</p>
<p>“The bell-pull,” I said. “In the Reading Room. If he’d sounded the
alarm…”</p>
<p>“It wouldn’t have been for thieves,” Alaric finished. “It would have
been for a breach of conditioning. For two assets showing dangerous
cognitive reversion.” He closed the ledger gently. “He should have
pulled it. It was his duty.”</p>
<p>“But he didn’t.”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>We stood in the silence, the truth settling over us like the dust. We
were not men wronged. We were artifacts of a wrong. We were living
testaments to a violence so complete it erased itself. We were the
punchline.</p>
<p>“What do we do with this?” I asked. The ledger between us was no
longer a treasure or a coffin. It was a mirror. And the thing in the
mirror was a stranger wearing our skin.</p>
<p>Alaric’s maimed hand rested on the cover. “We find the rest of the
joke.”</p>
<p>“What does that mean?”</p>
<p>“It means this is only the ledger entry. The <em>what</em>. We need
the <em>why</em>.” He looked at me, and for the first time, I saw not
the clerk, not the conditioned shell, but the ghost of the man who might
have been Item 48. A man with a sharp mind and a missing finger and a
reason to fight. “Why was the Ashen Dog targeted? Why were we,
specifically, kept and retuned? Why put a literate man with a head
injury in a field? Why put a clerk with a maimed hand in an archive?
It’s not just efficiency. There’s a shape to it. A cruelty.”</p>
<p>He was right. The conditioning was a mockery. It placed us in roles
that echoed our old selves, but broken. A fighter among turnips. A
scribe who could never write properly again. It was a message. <em>Look
what we can make of you.</em></p>
<p>“The supplemental folio mentioned a master record,” I said. “The
archivist’s personal log. The one he said didn’t exist.”</p>
<p>“The one he would die to protect,” Alaric said. A grim, understanding
smile touched his lips. It was a terrible sight. “That’s where the
<em>why</em> will be. The architect’s notes.”</p>
<p>“We can’t go back. He’ll be waiting. The bell-pull will be
manned.”</p>
<p>“We don’t go back to the Reading Room.” Alaric’s eyes were on the
candle flame, seeing through it. “He has a study. A private space. All
archivists do. It won’t be in the tower proper. Too many clerks. Too
much chance of being seen. It will be adjacent. Separate.”</p>
<p>A memory surfaced. Not mine. The archive’s layout, absorbed through
years of conditioned service. “The scriptorium annex. The old one,
behind the herb garden. It’s a ruin. But there’s a lower level… a cellar
they used for storing vellum.”</p>
<p>“That’s where he’ll be,” Alaric said. “Guarding the master key.
Waiting to see if his corrupted assets are stupid enough to come digging
for their own ghosts.”</p>
<p>“And if we are?”</p>
<p>He blew out the candle.</p>
<p>The dark was instant and total, a blow to the senses. His voice came
from it, close by. “Then we prove him right.”</p>
<p>We left the ledger in the shed, hidden under a sack of petrified
grain. It was too dangerous to carry. It was also no longer the point.
The facts of our unmaking were now etched inside us, a cold, permanent
script. We didn’t need the book. We were the book.</p>
<p>We moved through the outer compound like stains on the night. The
suppressed riot had done its work; the guards were clustered at the
gatehouse, voices raised in post-conflict exhaustion and bravado. The
inner keep was quieter, a slumbering beast. We avoided the postern
gate—it would be watched now—and instead went over the wall where the
stables backed against it, using a midden heap for height and the
ancient, crumbling mortar for fingerholds. We dropped into the herb
garden, the scent of crushed thyme and sage rising around us.</p>
<p>The scriptorium annex was a dark silhouette against the slightly
lighter sky. It was a small, sad building, its roof sagging, one window
shuttered. The door was oak, bound in iron, and it was locked.</p>
<p>Alaric didn’t hesitate. He knelt, felt along the bottom edge, found
the gap where the stone threshold had settled. From his boot, he drew a
thin piece of flexible horn, the kind used for smoothing vellum. He
slipped it into the gap, worked it upward. A soft <em>click</em>. He
pushed, and the door swung inward on silent, well-oiled hinges.</p>
<p>Of course. The archivist kept his secrets accessible. To himself.</p>
<p>The inside was not a ruin. It was pristine. A single room, lined with
shelves holding not books, but boxes. Iron boxes. Each with a complex
lock. A large, scarred table dominated the center, bare except for a
green-shaded lamp, unlit. And at the far end, a hearth, cold and clean.
A chair sat beside it. A reading chair.</p>
<p>It was empty.</p>
<p>“He’s not here,” I whispered.</p>
<p>“He is,” Alaric said. He wasn’t looking at the chair. He was looking
at the floor. At the flagstones near the hearth. One was slightly darker
than the others, its edges too regular.</p>
<p>He walked to it, knelt, and pressed the edges in a specific sequence.
A hidden catch released. The flagstone lifted, on a silent pivot,
revealing a narrow set of stone steps descending into blackness. A
faint, warm glow emanated from below.</p>
<p>The smell that wafted up was familiar: beeswax, old paper, and the
faint, sweet-metallic scent of the archivist’s tonic.</p>
<p>Alaric went first. I followed.</p>
<p>The cellar was a vault. Low-ceilinged, lined with more iron boxes.
And in the center, at a small desk, the archivist sat.</p>
<p>He was not reading. He was not writing. He was simply sitting, his
hands folded neatly on the desk, his head slightly tilted, as if
listening to distant music. The master ledger—larger, bound in plain
black leather—lay closed before him. A single candle in a silver stick
burned at his elbow, its flame steady in the still air.</p>
<p>He looked up as we reached the bottom step. His expression was one of
profound, weary resignation.</p>
<p>“Items 47 and 48,” he said. His voice was soft, almost kind. “You
took the scenic route. But you arrived. I knew you would. The protocols
have a… a yearning built into them. A homing instinct for the truth. A
flaw in the design, perhaps. Or a feature.”</p>
<p>Alaric took a step forward. “We want the master log.”</p>
<p>“You are standing in it,” the archivist said, gesturing vaguely at
the room. “This is the master log. The boxes. The true names. The
before. The unmaking. The cost.” He looked at me, his eyes magnified by
his spectacles. “Do you really wish to meet the man you were, Emeric? He
was… louder than you. Angrier. He believed in things. It was terribly
inconvenient.”</p>
<p>“Tell us why,” I said. My voice sounded like the voice of Item 47.
Dull. Compliant.</p>
<p>The archivist smiled, a thin, paper-cut of a smile. “Why? Because you
were on the wrong side of history. The Ashen Dog wasn’t just a free
company. It was an idea. A contagion. You believed people should choose
their own lords. That land should belong to those who work it. That
memory—true, unedited memory—was a birthright.” He sighed. “Noble. And
utterly destructive. Sir Guy’s lands border the marches. Your ‘idea’ was
a fire on his doorstep. He couldn’t kill you all. Martyrs are such
fertile ground for more ideas. So he, with our assistance, made an
example. He turned the leaders into… well. Into you.”</p>
<p>He opened the black ledger. He did not turn it for us to see. He read
from it, his voice a dry recitation.</p>
<p>“Item 47. Formerly Caden, called the Stone Dog. Lieutenant of the
Ashen Dog. Primary ideologue. Captured at the Battle of the Lark’s Ford.
Conditioning focus: eradication of symbolic thought, reinforcement of
base material struggle.”</p>
<p>“Item 48. Formerly Kael, the Quiet Knife. Strategist and archivist
for the company. Captured while attempting to secure company records.
Conditioning focus: redirection of analytical faculties to trivial,
systemic maintenance, physical reminder of failed action.”</p>
<p>Caden. Kael.</p>
<p>The names meant nothing. They were labels on an empty jar.</p>
<p>But the man—the archivist—was watching us. Waiting for a crack. For
the ghost to show through the shell.</p>
<p>“You broke us,” Alaric—Kael—said. There was no emotion in it.</p>
<p>“We <em>repaired</em> you,” the archivist corrected. “Into something
useful. You were a weapon. Now you are a tool. There is more dignity in
it than you think.” He leaned forward. “You have your truth. You have
the <em>why</em>. It changes nothing. The men you were are gone. You are
Emeric and Alaric. You have a tenure. You have a place. A flawed one,
but a place. Go back to it. The field. The archive. The ledger you stole
will be noted as misplaced. A clerical error. You can live. As you
are.”</p>
<p>He was offering us the lie back. The turnip field. The dust. The
small, sad story. It was a act of mercy. A final, cruel mercy.</p>
<p>I looked at Alaric. His face was a mask. But his eyes were on the
archivist’s hands, on the black ledger.</p>
<p>“The master key,” Alaric said. “Where is it?”</p>
<p>The archivist’s smile faded. “There is no key. The conditioning is
the lock. And the lock <em>is</em> the key. You cannot pick it. You can
only turn it from the inside. And to do that, you must first believe you
are locked in.” He closed the black ledger with a soft, definitive
<em>thump</em>. “Which you do. So. The process is complete. You are now
fully aware of your prison. Congratulations. It is the final stage of
your pacification.”</p>
<p>The air left the room. The candle flame guttered.</p>
<p>He had let us take the ledger. He had known we would come here. He
had guided us, step by step, to this cellar, to this truth. Not to free
us. To complete us. To make our imprisonment perfect, because now we
would know the walls were there. We would feel every inch of our
cage.</p>
<p>The punchline wasn’t that we had forgotten. The punchline was that we
would remember, and be powerless.</p>
<p>The archivist watched the understanding dawn on our faces. He nodded,
satisfied. A teacher whose pupils have finally grasped the lesson.</p>
<p>“The bell-pull upstairs,” he said gently. “It’s not connected to the
guardhouse. It’s connected to a chime in Sir Guy’s private chambers. It
tells him his assets have achieved final cognitive alignment. That the
pacification is, at long last, absolute.” He gestured to the stairs.
“You may go. Your tenure continues. You are, and will always be,
useful.”</p>
<p>He had won. He had written the last entry in our story.</p>
<p>Alaric took a step toward the desk. Then another. His movements were
slow, deliberate. The movements of a clerk.</p>
<p>The archivist did not flinch. He had no fear of his tools.</p>
<p>Alaric reached the desk. He looked down at the black ledger. Then he
looked at the archivist’s face, at the weary, triumphant intelligence in
his eyes.</p>
<p>“You’re wrong,” Alaric said, his voice barely a whisper.</p>
<p>“About what?”</p>
<p>“About the lock.”</p>
<p>And Alaric—Kael, the Quiet Knife, the strategist who had tried to
secure the records—brought his maimed hand down on the desk. Not on the
ledger. On the silver candlestick.</p>
<p>The candle snuffed out. The cellar plunged into a blackness so thick
it felt solid.</p>
<p>In the dark, the archivist made a small, startled sound. A mouse in a
cupboard.</p>
<p>And I moved.</p>
<p>Not as Emeric. Not as Item 47. But as the ghost of a man who had
believed in things. A man who was louder. Angrier.</p>
<p>My hands found the archivist in the dark. They found his throat. They
were the hands that had held a spade, that had turned the pages of a
ledger. They were strong from useless labor.</p>
<p>He struggled. He was surprisingly frail. A man of paper and dust.</p>
<p>“The bell-pull—” he choked out.</p>
<p>“Let it chime,” a voice said in the dark. Alaric’s voice. From
somewhere else. From near the stairs. “Let him come. Let him see his
useful tools.”</p>
<p>I did not squeeze. I held him there, in the absolute dark, at the
edge of silence. I could feel the frantic beat of his heart against my
thumbs. He had no weapon but his knowledge. And his knowledge had
brought him here, to this.</p>
<p>“You can’t… undo it,” he rasped. “The conditioning… it’s in the
grain… it’s who you are…”</p>
<p>“I know,” I said into the dark. And I did. The field was in me. The
debt was in me. The name Emeric was a scar.</p>
<p>But Caden was in there, too. Buried under the turnips. A stone dog,
waiting.</p>
<p>I released him. He slumped back into his chair, gasping.</p>
<p>A spark flared in the black. Alaric had relit the candle. He held it
aloft. His face was calm. The archivist stared at us, his neatness
ruined, his spectacles askew, terror in his eyes for the first time.</p>
<p>We were not aligned. We were broken. And a broken tool has sharp
edges.</p>
<p>Alaric picked up the black ledger from the desk. He didn’t open it.
He simply held it.</p>
<p>“He’ll come for this,” the archivist whispered. “Sir Guy. He’ll come
for you. You have nowhere to go.”</p>
<p>Alaric looked at me over the flame. In his eyes, I saw no plan. No
strategy. Only a simple, devastating truth.</p>
<p>“We go to the field,” he said.</p>
<p>He turned and started up the stairs.</p>
<p>I followed. I did not look back at the archivist, at the man in his
vault of truths. He was part of the ledger now. An entry to be
closed.</p>
<p>We emerged into the annex, then into the herb garden, the cold night
air a shock. Somewhere, in the keep, a single, sweet chime was sounding.
The bell-pull had been used.</p>
<p>Sir Guy knew.</p>
<p>We did not run. We walked. Past the stables, through the outer
compound, toward the postern gate. No one stopped us. We were two
clerks. We belonged.</p>
<p>The guard at the postern was new, young. He saw our faces in the
torchlight, our empty hands. Alaric gave a slight, weary nod. The guard,
conditioned to recognize the mannerisms of authority, nodded back and
opened the small gate.</p>
<p>We stepped out of Blackwater Keep, onto the road that led down to the
village, to the fields, to the world.</p>
<p>We had nowhere to go. But we had a place to start.</p>
<p>The field. The turnips. The dirt. The place where I had been
made.</p>
<p>It was the site of the crime. And the first place they would look for
the evidence.</p>
<p>As we walked into the vast, starless dark, the black ledger under
Alaric’s arm, I understood the final, terrible twist of the joke.</p>
<p>We were not escaping to freedom.</p>
<p>We were going back to the beginning, to dig up the very first
lie.</p>
<p>And we were going to plant it with their blood.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-23">Chapter 23</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-23-1"><strong>CHAPTER 23</strong></h2>
<p>The road was not a road but a memory of one, a scar of packed dirt
and flint that remembered cart-wheels and feet. It led away from the
keep’s torch-glow, down into a bowl of darkness where the village slept.
We did not take it. Alaric veered off it as soon as the postern gate’s
light was a pinprick behind us, striking out across the fallow strip
that bordered the lord’s wood. The cold was the kind that settles into
the marrow, a patient, silent thief. My breath plumed, a ghost I left
behind with every step.</p>
<p>I followed. My feet knew the way better than my mind did. The field
was a geography written in my bones, a map of labour and forgetting. We
moved through a world stripped of detail, just shapes of deeper black
against the lesser black of the sky. The ledger under Alaric’s arm was
the only solid thing. A tombstone. A deed.</p>
<p>We did not speak. Speech was a currency we had spent in the
archivist’s vault. What was left was the raw material of being: the
crunch of frost under boot, the saw of breath, the weight of the cold in
our lungs. I was a set of operations. <em>Lift foot. Place foot. Breathe
in. Breathe out.</em> The name <em>Emeric</em> was a label on an empty
jar. The man who had answered to it in the turnip field, who had feared
Baldric’s scorn and Sir Guy’s rent, was a story I had been told. A
plausible fiction.</p>
<p>The woods loomed, a ragged wall. Alaric skirted its edge, his
movements sure. He was not navigating by sight. He was navigating by a
different sense, the one that knows where pain is buried. We came to a
break in the tree-line, a narrow path used by charcoal-burners. He
entered it without pause. The darkness became absolute, a swallowing,
textured thing. Branches clawed at my cloak. Roots sought my ankles. I
kept my eyes on the faint, shifting silhouette of his back, the pale
smudge of the ledger’s binding.</p>
<p>After a time measured only in heartbeats and stumbles, the trees
thinned. We emerged into a clearing that was not a clearing, but a
wound. The field.</p>
<p>It lay under the starless sky, a vast, open grave. The turnips were
long harvested, the earth raw and ridged from the spade. It smelled of
frozen dirt and rotten leaves, a scent that unlocked a door in the back
of my skull. I stopped at the edge of the tree-line. My hands remembered
the wooden spade. My shoulders remembered the ache. Here was the stage.
Here was where the play had begun, with a man who had forgotten his
lines.</p>
<p>Alaric walked a few paces into the open and stopped. He set the
ledger down on a frosted hummock of earth, carefully, as if laying a
child to rest. He stood looking out over the field, his hands hanging
loose at his sides.</p>
<p>“This is it,” he said. His voice was flat, worn smooth. “The
administrative centre of the world.”</p>
<p>He did not sound like Alaric. He sounded like a man reading his own
epitaph.</p>
<p>I walked to stand beside him. The keep was a distant, jagged lump
against the sky, a rotten tooth. No lights moved on its walls. The bell
had chimed, and then silence. A trap being set does not make a
sound.</p>
<p>“What do we do here?” I asked. The question was mechanical. A spade
driving into earth.</p>
<p>“We wait for them to come,” he said. “And we read them the
books.”</p>
<p>“They will kill us first.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>The simplicity of it was a kind of mercy. There was no more strategy.
No more ledgers within ledgers. We had the evidence. We were the
evidence. We had walked out of the keep and into the open page of our
own closing entry. Sir Guy would come. His men would come. They would
see two mad clerks in a turnip field with a stolen ledger. The story
would be simple. It would be true enough. Thieves caught. Justice done.
The archive would remain neat.</p>
<p>“Why come here, then?” I said. “Why not just lie down in the
road?”</p>
<p>Alaric looked at me. In the profound dark, his face was all hollow
and angle. “Because the road is just a road. This is the source. The
first line of the account.” He nudged the ledger with his toe. “This
book doesn’t start with Sir Guy. It starts with a grant of land. A
survey. A map. It starts with this dirt.” He bent, scooped a handful of
the frozen earth, let it crumble through his fingers. “They built him
out of paper and ink and this dirt. They built me to manage the
construction. And they built you to forget that any of it ever
happened.”</p>
<p>The wind moved across the field, a low, grieving sound. It was the
sound of the balance sheet, settling.</p>
<p>“I remembered something,” I said. The words felt like stones in my
mouth. “In the vault. When he was… when you were asking him. I
remembered the knife.”</p>
<p>Alaric was still. “What knife?”</p>
<p>“The one I had. Before. Not a kitchen knife. A fighting knife. I
remembered the feel of the grip. The weight. I was good with it.” I
looked at my empty hands. They were clerk’s hands, stained with ink, not
blood. But the memory of the other hands was in them, a ghost-limb. “I
wasn’t a farmer.”</p>
<p>“No,” Alaric said softly. “You were not.”</p>
<p>“What was I?”</p>
<p>He was silent for a long time. “I don’t know. A soldier, perhaps. A
guardsman. Someone with a skill that became inconvenient. Someone who
asked the wrong question in the wrong tavern. Someone whose face fit the
space they needed to fill.” He turned to face me fully. “They didn’t
just take your memory, Emeric. They gave you a new one. They planted
Baldric, and the rent, and the turnips. They watered it with routine and
fear until it grew over whatever was there before. Until you believed
the harvest was all there was.”</p>
<p>The field seemed to tilt under me. The ridges of earth were not just
ridges; they were furrows in my own mind. Tilled and seeded. I had grown
here. I had been cultivated.</p>
<p>“And you?” I asked. “What did they give you?”</p>
<p>A smile touched his lips, a crack in stone. “They gave me the
numbers. They saw a boy who could find patterns in chaos, who could make
columns add up. They gave me purpose. They made me the keeper of the
lie. They made it my masterpiece.” He gestured to the ledger. “I am the
signature on the forgery. My life’s work is a monument to a man who does
not exist, built on land that was never his, paid for with blood that
was never accounted for. I am the architect of the fiction. That is my
function.”</p>
<p>His calm was the most terrifying thing I had ever witnessed. It was
the calm of a ledger that has been reconciled to the penny, of an entry
that admits its own falsehood.</p>
<p>“So we are both ghosts,” I said. “You are the ghost of the
accountant. I am the ghost of the… whatever I was. Haunting the site of
our own murder.”</p>
<p>“We are the audit,” he corrected. “The one that was never meant to
happen. The internal review that discovered the cancer is not in the
books, but is the books. We are the error that cannot be corrected. So
we must be erased.”</p>
<p>From the direction of the keep, a dog barked. Once, twice. A sharp,
professional sound. Then silence again.</p>
<p>They were coming. The erasers.</p>
<p>Alaric did not turn. He sat down on the frozen ground, cross-legged,
facing the ledger as if it were a hearth. He took off his gloves, laid
them aside. His hands were pale, slender, precise. The hands that had
written it all down.</p>
<p>“We should burn it,” I said. “Deny them the proof.”</p>
<p>“It is not proof,” he said. “It is a narrative. Burning it would be
an edit. A revision. I am done with revisions.” He opened the cover. The
pages were a pool of blackness. “We will let them see it. Let them see
the shape of the thing they made. Let them see their own
signatures.”</p>
<p>“They will not care.”</p>
<p>“No,” he agreed. “They will not. But I will. In the last moment, I
will know that I saw the whole ledger. That I understood the cost. That
is the only balance that matters to me now.”</p>
<p>The dog barked again, closer. A horse whinnied. They were on the road
now. They would find our tracks veering off. They would have men who
could read the ground like a page.</p>
<p>I sat down beside him. The cold of the earth seeped through my
clothes, a familiar anchor. I had sat here before, in the mud, eating a
piece of hard bread, my back aching. A memory that was not a memory. A
grafted limb that itched.</p>
<p>“Tell me,” I said. “Before they come. Tell me what you know. Not the
numbers. The story.”</p>
<p>Alaric kept his eyes on the closed ledger. His voice, when it came,
was low and even, the voice of a man reading a dry inventory. But the
inventory was of a soul.</p>
<p>“Sir Guy de Mortain arrived twenty-three years ago. He had a patent
from a crown that had too many wars to fight to check its own paperwork.
He had soldiers. He had a surveyor. He had a clerk—a senior man from the
Chancery, bought and paid for. My predecessor. They came to this valley.
There was a freeholding here. A few families. Good land. Well-tended. It
was not on any royal map. It was… a blank space. An opportunity.”</p>
<p>The wind carried the jingle of a bit, faint as a whisper.</p>
<p>“They presented their documents. The freeholders could not read them.
They argued. There was… resistance. Not a battle. A skirmish. A messy,
brutal little affair in a farmyard. The freeholders were removed. The
senior clerk recorded it as a ‘tenancy adjustment, with associated
compensations.’ The compensations were entered as a debt against the new
tenants. A debt they could never repay. Serfdom, created with a flourish
of a pen.”</p>
<p>He traced the edge of the ledger’s cover.</p>
<p>“The senior clerk was a thorough man. He saw the potential. A blank
space on a map is a vacuum. Nature—and accounting—abhors a vacuum. You
can fill it with anything. So he began to fill it. Fictitious
improvements to the land. Inflated yields. Phantom tenants who paid
rent. Loans from Sir Guy to the estate at usurious rates. The
estate—which was Sir Guy—owed money to Sir Guy. A perfect, closed loop.
The debt compounded. The value of the ‘estate’ grew on paper. That paper
value was used as collateral for more patents, more ‘land acquisitions’
in neighbouring valleys. The same pattern. Resistance. Removal.
Compensation. Debt. It is a machine, Emeric. You feed in blood and fear,
and it prints out legitimacy.”</p>
<p>My throat was tight. “And you?”</p>
<p>“I was a workhouse boy. Sharp with numbers. The senior clerk took me
as an apprentice. He was proud of his machine. He wanted someone to
appreciate its elegance. He taught me everything. How to layer the false
entries. How to back-date. How to use the truth as a seasoning—a real
name, a real place—to make the lie taste real. He died eight years ago.
Gout and bad wine. I became the archivist. The keeper of the machine. I
oiled it. I improved it. I believed in its necessity. Order is
preferable to chaos. A neat ledger is a moral good.”</p>
<p>He closed his eyes for a moment. “Then you came.”</p>
<p>I stared at him. “Me.”</p>
<p>“Three years ago. You were brought in by Sir Guy’s guards. You had
been found on the road, you said. You couldn’t remember. You were
strong. You were placid. You took orders. Baldric’s wife had just died,
leaving him short-handed. You were a solution. You were entered into the
ledger as ‘Emeric, tenant-at-sufferance, labour-rent allocation.’
Another entry. Another number.” He opened his eyes and looked at me.
“But you were wrong.”</p>
<p>“Wrong?”</p>
<p>“You didn’t fit. Your hands. The way you moved. The way you sometimes
looked at a gate, or a weapon, with a… recognition. You were a smudge on
the page. An irregularity. I started to watch you. Not out of suspicion.
Out of a clerk’s fastidiousness. I wanted to correct the entry. To
understand the anomaly. And the more I watched, the more I saw that you
were not the only anomaly. The machine had glitches. Small ones. A
tenant who died but whose rent was still collected. A field that flooded
every year but was logged as prime acreage. The lies were not holding
their shape. They were straining. I began to… to check my own work. To
trace the entries back. A private audit.”</p>
<p>He let out a long, slow breath. “I found the first page. The original
grant. I found the forgery. My master’s hand. I found the blood debt,
the very first one, entered in a different ink. I realized I was not
maintaining order. I was tending a garden of poison. And you… you were a
seed from the old crop, the one that had been ploughed under. You had
sprung up in the poisoned soil. You were proof the ground was still
wrong.”</p>
<p>Torchlight. A flicker, far off, at the edge of the woods near the
road. They were searching the tree-line.</p>
<p>“So you woke me up,” I said.</p>
<p>“I tried. I left the knife where you would find it. I left the old
rent-rolls in your hut. I asked you questions about your past, hoping to
trigger something. It was like shouting into a well. I heard only the
echo of the story they had given you. But then you started to dream. You
started to say words in your sleep. Words that were not in a
turnip-farmer’s vocabulary. You said ‘picket.’ You said ‘watch
rotation.’ You said ‘sergeant.’”</p>
<p>My skin went cold. The words meant nothing, and everything. They were
the shape of the hole inside me.</p>
<p>“I knew then I had to break the ledger,” Alaric said. “Not correct
it. Break it. To do that, I needed the key. The black ledger. The master
index. My master had shown it to me once, a sacred text. It linked every
false entry to every other. It was the blueprint of the machine. Sir Guy
kept it. I knew where. But I could not get it alone. I needed a
distraction. I needed… a second anomaly. I needed you to become
undeniable. So I engineered the rent crisis. I manipulated Baldric. I
made sure you would be pushed to the edge, that you would do something
desperate, something the machine could not absorb. You did. You came to
the archive. You became my excuse to go to the vault. My chaos.”</p>
<p>The torchlight split into two points. They had found our path.</p>
<p>“You used me,” I said. There was no anger in it. It was a statement
of account.</p>
<p>“Yes. I entered you into a new transaction. High risk. Potential for
total loss.” He finally looked at me. “I am sorry. Not for the ledger.
For that.”</p>
<p>The apology hung between us, another foreign coin. I did not know its
value.</p>
<p>“What do we do when they get here?” I asked.</p>
<p>“We show them the book,” he said. “We tell them the story. We make
them see the shape of it, if only for a second. And then we die here, in
the field where it started. The ledger will be closed. The circle will
be complete.”</p>
<p>It was a terrible, perfect balance. A zero-sum game.</p>
<p>The torchlight was moving steadily down the charcoal-burner’s path
now. We could see the shapes of men behind them, the glint of mail.
Four. Five. More. They moved without haste. They knew we had nowhere to
go.</p>
<p>I stood up. My legs were stiff with cold and dread. Alaric remained
seated, his hand resting on the ledger. He looked like a scholar at his
final lecture.</p>
<p>I looked out at the field, at the dark, tainted earth. This was the
source. The first lie. They had built a world on it. They had built me
on it. I was a lie that had learned to walk and talk and fear the
rent.</p>
<p>But I had remembered the knife.</p>
<p>Not the memory. The <em>feel</em> of it. The muscle-deep knowledge of
balance, of grip, of the sweet, short arc of a thrust. That was not a
lie. That was a truth written in sinew and bone. A truth they had not
been able to plough under.</p>
<p>The torches emerged from the tree-line. Sir Guy was not with them. It
was the captain of his guard, a man named Rolf, with a face like a
hatchet and eyes that reflected flame. Six men fanned out behind him,
swords drawn. They saw us. Two clerks in a field. One sitting, one
standing. A book between them.</p>
<p>Rolf held up a hand. His men stopped. The silence was profound,
broken only by the crackle of pitch-pine torches and the restless shift
of mail.</p>
<p>“Archivist,” Rolf called. His voice was bored, professional. “You
have something that belongs to the Lord of Blackwater.”</p>
<p>Alaric did not look up. “It belongs to no one. It is a record of
theft. You cannot own a record of your own crime.”</p>
<p>“Pretty words.” Rolf took a few steps forward. His boots sank into
the soft earth. “Give me the book. Come back quietly. This can be the
end of it.”</p>
<p>“It is the end of it,” Alaric said. “But not your end. Ours.” He
opened the ledger. “Would you like me to read you your part? It begins
with your father. Tenant Holm. His compensation for the loss of his
freehold was entered as a debt of fifteen silver marks. He could not
pay. You were indentured to the guard at age twelve to service the
interest. Your life is an entry on page forty-seven. You are a
line-item, Rolf.”</p>
<p>Rolf’s face did not change. He had heard this before, or some version
of it. He was a product of the machine. He believed in its output. “Last
chance, clerk.”</p>
<p>Alaric began to read. His voice was clear, carrying in the still,
cold air. “<em>Anno Regis, folio nineteen. Disbursement for pacification
services, Midsummer. One barrel of ale, two sides of beef, one piece of
silver each to men-at-arms Rolf, Cedric, Marten…</em>”</p>
<p>Rolf nodded. One of his men, a big man with a spear, started
forward.</p>
<p>I moved.</p>
<p>It was not a decision. It was an equation that solved itself in my
nerves. I stepped between the spearman and Alaric. My hands were empty.
I held them out to my sides.</p>
<p>The spearman hesitated, looking back at Rolf.</p>
<p>“He’s just the farmer, captain,” one of the other men said. “The
stupid one.”</p>
<p>Rolf’s hatchet-face considered me. “Step aside, turnip-brain. This
doesn’t concern you.”</p>
<p>“It does,” I said. My voice sounded strange to me. It had a different
register. It came from a place below the fear. “I am an entry, too. Page
one. The original anomaly.”</p>
<p>Rolf sighed. “Take him. Gently. He’s still worth a day’s labour.”</p>
<p>Two men came forward, swords sheathed, hands out to grab me.</p>
<p>The memory was not a picture. It was a set of instructions.</p>
<p>When the first man reached for my arm, I caught his wrist, turned my
body, and used his momentum to throw him past me into the second man.
They went down in a clatter of mail and a puff of frost. It was fast.
Fluid. A movement my body had performed ten thousand times in another
life.</p>
<p>Silence, thicker than before.</p>
<p>Rolf’s eyes narrowed. The bored professionalism evaporated, replaced
by a sharp, assessing focus. “Well,” he said softly. “There’s a glitch
in the field.”</p>
<p>He drew his sword. The sound was a long, cold sigh.</p>
<p>“Disable him,” he said to the remaining men. “Break his legs. Keep
the archivist alive for now.”</p>
<p>Four men advanced. Swords out. They were not brutes. They were
professionals. They came in a loose half-circle, careful on the uneven
ground.</p>
<p>I had no weapon. I had a field. I backed up, my heels feeling the
ridges of earth. Alaric had stopped reading. He watched, his face a mask
of horrified fascination.</p>
<p>The first attack was a testing thrust from the left. I sidestepped,
felt the wind of the blade. The man on the right came in low, aiming for
my thigh. I kicked, not at him, but at the frosted clod of earth at his
feet. Dirt and ice sprayed into his face. He flinched. In that second, I
was on him, driving my elbow into the side of his helmet. The impact
jolted up my arm. He staggered. I yanked the dagger from his belt,
turned, and parried a downstroke from the third man.</p>
<p>The shock of steel on steel rang across the field. It was a bell I
remembered. A chime that called me to a different duty.</p>
<p>My body knew. My mind was a spectator. I was not Emeric the tenant. I
was the set of instructions. <em>Parry. Slip. Step. Lunge.</em> The
dagger was short, pitiful against their swords. But the field was my
ally. The dark, the uneven ground, their own numbers that got in each
other’s way. I was a shadow among them. I cut one across the back of his
sword-hand. He cursed, dropped his weapon. I ducked under a wild swing,
came up inside the guard of another, and drove the dagger’s pommel into
his throat. He gagged, fell to his knees.</p>
<p>But I was one man with a dagger. They were armed, armoured, and
angry.</p>
<p>A blade caught me. A searing line of fire across my ribs. I gasped,
stumbled back. Another pommel struck the side of my head. Light exploded
behind my eyes. The world tilted. I went down on one knee in the
dirt.</p>
<p>Rolf stood over me. His sword-point hovered at my eye. “Enough of
this,” he said. He looked past me to Alaric. “Throw me the book,
archivist. Or I put this through his brain and make you watch before we
take you apart.”</p>
<p>I knelt in the turnip dirt, blood warm on my side, my head ringing.
This was the expected outcome. The balanced ledger. The anomaly
corrected.</p>
<p>Alaric looked from Rolf’s sword to my face. His eyes were wide. He
saw the blood, the defeat. He saw the end of his audit.</p>
<p>Slowly, he closed the black ledger. He held it in both hands.</p>
<p>Then he did not throw it to Rolf.</p>
<p>He threw it to me.</p>
<p>The book spun through the torchlit air, a black bird. It was not a
weapon. It was a testament. I caught it against my chest, the impact
jarring my wound.</p>
<p>Rolf snarled, a sound of pure fury. His sword-point tensed for the
thrust.</p>
<p>And from the woods, a new voice spoke.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t.”</p>
<p>It was a woman’s voice. Cool. Dry. Utterly certain.</p>
<p>Everyone froze. Rolf’s sword did not move from my eye, but his head
turned.</p>
<p>She stood at the edge of the tree-line, where the path emerged. She
was alone. She wore a dark, travel-stained cloak, but it was thrown back
over her shoulders. In her hands was a crossbow. It was not levelled. It
was held casually, but the quarry-bolt was seated, and her finger was on
the trigger. She looked at the scene—the men, the blood, the two clerks
in the dirt—with the detached interest of a naturalist observing a
peculiar insect colony.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Rolf barked. “This is Blackwater land. Be on your
way.”</p>
<p>“Is it?” the woman said. She took a few steps forward. Her boots made
no sound on the frozen earth. “The charter says the western wood marks
the boundary. You are… forty paces into the wood, by my count. This is
Crown land. You are trespassing. And threatening Crown subjects with
violence.” She nodded toward me and Alaric. “These two. They are Crown
subjects, are they not? Tenants of a crown vassal? Or has Sir Guy
declared independence and not informed the tax collectors?”</p>
<p>Her voice was educated. It had the clipped, precise accent of the
capital. It was the voice of paperwork that could raise armies.</p>
<p>Rolf’s certainty wavered. The machine only worked within its own
borders. This woman spoke from outside it. “These men are thieves. They
have stolen Lord Guy’s property. We are retrieving it. This is a
manorial matter.”</p>
<p>“The book?” the woman said. She glanced at the ledger in my arms.
“That looks like a manorial record. The theft of which is, indeed, a
manorial matter. But the wounding of tenants on Crown land during its
retrieval… that becomes a matter for the King’s Justices. As does the
bearing of arms beyond your lord’s demarcation. As does,” she added, her
gaze sweeping over the men, “the probable poaching of the King’s deer I
smell on at least two of you. The penalties for that are quite severe.
Mutilation, I believe.”</p>
<p>The men shuffled. The spearman who had first advanced looked at the
woods with new fear.</p>
<p>“You have no authority here,” Rolf said, but the blade at my eye
trembled, just slightly.</p>
<p>“I have the authority of the Royal Surveyor’s Office,” the woman
said. She reached into her cloak with her free hand, pulled out a sealed
tube of leather, and tossed it at Rolf’s feet. It landed with a thud in
the dirt. “My commission. You may read it, if you are literate. The
short version is: I am mapping the boundaries of every crown fief in
this hundred. Checking for… discrepancies. I was camped in the wood,
taking star-sights, when I heard a disturbance. I investigated. I
witnessed an armed incursion onto Crown land and an assault. My report
will reflect that.”</p>
<p>Rolf did not pick up the tube. He stared at her. The torchlight
flickered across his face, showing the calculations behind his eyes. He
could kill us. Kill her. Bury us all in this field. But she had a
commission. She would be missed. Her office would ask questions. The
machine could absorb a lot, but not the direct scrutiny of the Crown.
Not now. Not here.</p>
<p>It was a stalemate written in law and leverage.</p>
<p>“The book,” Rolf said finally, his voice gritted. “It goes with
me.”</p>
<p>The woman shrugged. “If it is Lord Guy’s property, and you can prove
it, you may petition the manor court for its return. From these men. Who
will, of course, have the right to plead their case. Due process. The
foundation of the realm.” She smiled. It did not touch her eyes. “For
now, you are on my map. I suggest you get off it.”</p>
<p>Rolf’s knuckles were white on his sword hilt. The fury in him was a
physical heat. He looked down at me, at the ledger clutched to my chest.
He wanted to finish it. To erase the error.</p>
<p>But the woman’s crossbow was now pointed at the ground midway between
us. It was a subtle shift. It meant she could raise it and loose in a
heartbeat.</p>
<p>With a sound of disgust, Rolf lowered his sword. He stepped back.
“This isn’t over, clerk,” he said to Alaric. Then to me: “And you.
You’re dead. You just don’t know it yet.”</p>
<p>He turned. “With me.”</p>
<p>His men collected their wounded, their dropped weapons. They moved
back toward the tree-line, a retreat that felt like a coiled spring. The
torches withdrew, taking their circle of light with them, leaving us in
a deeper, colder dark.</p>
<p>The woman did not lower her crossbow until the last sound of them had
faded into the woods. Then she slung it over her shoulder and walked
toward us.</p>
<p>I struggled to my feet, clutching my side. Alaric stood slowly, his
eyes never leaving the woman.</p>
<p>She stopped a few paces away. She was older than I first thought,
lines of travel and weather around her eyes and mouth. Her hair,
escaping her hood, was streaked with grey. She looked at Alaric, then at
me, then at the book in my arms.</p>
<p>“Well,” she said. “You two have made a spectacular mess of a
perfectly corrupt little manor.”</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Alaric asked. His voice was hoarse.</p>
<p>“Elara,” she said. “Of the Royal Surveyor’s Office. That part was
true. The rest was… theatrical embellishment. I have no star-sights.
I’ve been watching Blackwater Keep for a fortnight. Waiting for a crack
to appear.” She nodded at the ledger. “I assume that is the crack.”</p>
<p>“It is the foundation,” Alaric said. “And the crack.”</p>
<p>Elara smiled, a real one this time, thin and sharp. “I thought it
might be. I’ve seen Sir Guy’s type before. His kind always builds on
sand and keeps the ledger of the sinking in a locked drawer.” She looked
at me, at the blood seeping through my clothes. “You need stitching. And
you,” she said to Alaric, “look like you need a drink that isn’t watered
with fear. My camp is in the wood. It’s defensible. For tonight.”</p>
<p>“Why help us?” I asked. The words were thick. The adrenaline was
draining away, leaving a vast, cold emptiness.</p>
<p>“Because my job is to find discrepancies between the map and the
territory,” she said. “You two are the mother of all discrepancies. You
are the territory fighting back against the map. I find that
professionally interesting.” Her gaze hardened. “And because Sir Guy’s
‘map’ has swallowed three freeholds I was personally tasked with
confirming. My reports have been… ignored. Filed away. I want to know
why. I think your book might tell me.”</p>
<p>She turned and started walking back toward the woods. “Coming? Or
would you prefer to wait for Rolf’s second attempt? He’ll come back with
more men, and a story for his lord that will make my commission look
like a child’s scribble.”</p>
<p>Alaric and I looked at each other. The field was no longer an end. It
was a crossroads. We had walked out of the keep to die in the truth.
Instead, we had been offered a temporary, precarious shelter by a woman
with a crossbow and a grievance.</p>
<p>It was not freedom. It was a stay of execution. A new column in the
ledger: <em>Liabilities: One Royal Surveyor. Assets: One night’s
respite.</em></p>
<p>I picked up the ledger. The black cover was smeared with my blood. A
new entry.</p>
<p>We followed Elara into the woods, leaving the turnip field behind.
The site of the first lie. The place where I had been made, and where I
had almost been unmade.</p>
<p>As the trees closed around us, I looked back once. The field was a
grey smudge in the darkness. Empty. Waiting.</p>
<p>But we were not in it anymore. We had been extracted. For now.</p>
<p>The hook for the final chapter was set. We had the evidence. We had a
witness from the outside world. And we had, for the first time, a path
that did not lead directly back to our own graves. It led into a deeper,
more dangerous wood—the wood of politics, of Crown authority, of a
reckoning that could burn down more than just a single corrupt manor.
The machine was bigger than Sir Guy. And we had just invited a new
operator to examine its workings.</p>
<p>The final audit was no longer a private suicide. It was about to
become a public trial. And we were the ledgers that would have to
testify.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-24">Chapter 24</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-24-1"><strong>CHAPTER 24</strong></h2>
<p>The first thing I remembered was the turnip field. It wasn’t a memory
of the place, but of the texture of forgetting. The grey light, the cold
spade, the name that fit like a borrowed coat. That was the seed.
Everything that grew after—the lies, the ledger, the blood, the fear—was
just a consequence of that first, quiet emptiness.</p>
<p>Now, the woods were a different kind of empty. They were full of
sound: the crunch of frost under Elara’s boots, the distant complaint of
an owl, the whisper of my own breath turning to smoke in the air. But
the emptiness was inside me. It had been filled, piece by piece, with a
fabricated life. Now those pieces were being taken out and examined
under a colder, more clinical light. The emptiness was returning, but it
was no longer clean. It was cluttered with the wreckage of who I’d been
told I was.</p>
<p>Elara led us to a hunter’s shelter, a low lean-to of moss-chinked
logs half-buried in a hillside. It smelled of damp earth and old smoke.
She moved with an economical certainty, striking a fire from a tinderbox
with three precise strikes. The flame caught, painting her sharp
features in gold and shadow.</p>
<p>“Sit,” she said, not looking at us. “If you’re going to bleed out,
I’d prefer you do it on the bracken and not on my boots.”</p>
<p>Alaric lowered himself onto a pile of old furs, his face pale. The
wound on his arm was a dark, glistening stain. I found myself kneeling
beside him, the motions still automatic. <em>The steward tends to the
guard.</em> I unwound the makeshift bandage. The cut was clean, but
deep. I looked up at Elara. She was rummaging in a pack.</p>
<p>“You have a commission from the Crown’s Surveyor-General,” I said. My
voice was flat. It was the first real sentence I’d spoken since the
field.</p>
<p>“I do.”</p>
<p>“To confirm freeholds.”</p>
<p>“To confirm <em>and map</em>,” she corrected, pulling out a roll of
linen and a small clay pot. “A survey is more than a tally. It is a
description of the world. Its purpose is to make reality legible to the
Crown. To turn soil and stone and wood into lines on vellum. Into
territory.” She tossed the linen to me. The pot followed. It contained a
pungent salve. “Apply that. It stings. It also prevents
mortification.”</p>
<p>I did as I was told. Alaric hissed through his teeth, his hand
clamping on my shoulder. His grip was still strong.</p>
<p>“Sir Guy’s maps,” I said, working the salve into the wound. “They are
inaccurate.”</p>
<p>“They are lies,” Elara said, settling on a stump across the fire. She
laid her crossbow across her knees. “Artful ones. The boundaries are
shifted. Streams are misdirected. A freehold of fifty acres becomes
forty in his survey, and the missing ten magically appear as part of his
own demesne. A wood held in common by three families is marked as barren
ground, then leased for his own timber. It is a slow, papery theft.” She
poked the fire with a stick. “My predecessor filed a preliminary
dissent. He died of a fever on the road back to the capital. His notes
vanished.”</p>
<p>“And your reports are ignored,” Alaric grunted.</p>
<p>“Filed away,” she nodded. “Which is a professional insult I do not
appreciate. But it is also a signal. Someone with sufficient influence
does not want this particular map corrected. Sir Guy is a petty lord
with a taste for other men’s turnips. He is not powerful enough to
silence the Surveyor-General’s office. So.” She looked at me, then at
the ledger I had placed beside me on the bracken. “You are a discrepancy
that cannot be filed away. A man who shouldn’t exist, with a book that
shouldn’t exist, on land that has been officially misrepresented. You
are a tear in the vellum.”</p>
<p>I finished binding Alaric’s arm. The fire was beginning to push back
the deep cold of the woods. I picked up the ledger. Its black cover was
a hole in the firelight.</p>
<p>“It’s not a book of accounts,” I said.</p>
<p>“I didn’t think it was,” Elara replied.</p>
<p>“It is a record of… maintenance.”</p>
<p>“Explain.”</p>
<p>So I did. I told her of the entries. <em>Emeric Conrad. Alaric of the
Fen. Millicent of the Crossroads.</em> The dates of our inception. The
quarterly stipends of silver and salt. The notes on our stability, our
believability. <em>Subject E.C. shows concerning episodic recall of
maritime terminology. Adjust narrative: add deceased uncle who was a
ferryman.</em> I told her of the Keep, not as a home, but as a set. Of
Sir Guy, not as a lord, but as a director. Of Rolf, as both enforcer and
stage manager.</p>
<p>I spoke in the same tone I had used to report on seed yields. A
clerical recitation. Alaric stared into the fire, his jaw set. He was a
fact in the ledger. A line item. Hearing it aloud was a different kind
of violence.</p>
<p>Elara listened without interruption. Her face was a surveyor’s map,
revealing nothing but careful attention. When I finished, the only sound
was the crackle of the fire and the wind in the high branches.</p>
<p>“A manufactory,” she said finally. “Not of cloth or iron. Of persons.
For what purpose?”</p>
<p>“The land,” Alaric said, his voice rough. “The freeholds. We are the
proof. The witnesses who swear before the bailiff that the map is true.
That the stream has always run there. That the oak marking the boundary
is the one that blighted last winter. We are the memory of the place. A
memory he writes for us.”</p>
<p>Elara’s eyes were chips of flint. “And when a freeholder contests?
When they appeal to the itinerant justice?”</p>
<p>“They appeal to us,” I said. “Their neighbours. The people they have
broken bread with for years. And we swear to the false map. Because it
is our truth. It is the only truth we have.”</p>
<p>“And if you begin to suspect? To remember?”</p>
<p>I met her gaze. “Then you are corrected. The narrative is adjusted.
Or you are retired. Like Millicent.”</p>
<p>The fire popped, sending a spiral of sparks into the dark.</p>
<p>“This is beyond a property dispute,” Elara said softly. It was not
excitement in her voice, but a grim, professional awe. “This is a
subversion of Crown authority at its root. The law is built upon
witness. Upon oath. If the witnesses can be forged… then the entire
ledger of the realm is suspect.” She leaned forward. “The book. May
I?”</p>
<p>I handed it to her. She opened it carefully, her fingers tracing the
columns of figures, the cryptic notes. She was not reading the story of
Emeric or Alaric. She was reading the blueprint of the machine.</p>
<p>“This is not Sir Guy’s work,” she said after a long moment. “The hand
is consistent, clerical. But the system… this is too elegant for a
turnip-thief with a small keep. This is methodology. This is protocol.”
She looked up. “You said ‘retired’. The ledger notes it?”</p>
<p>I nodded. “Page seventeen. <em>Subject M.o.C. retired. Assets
reallocated. Narrative: ague.</em>”</p>
<p>“And the body?”</p>
<p>“We buried her. In the wood. Near a lightning-struck elm.”</p>
<p>Elara closed the ledger. “We will need to exhume it.”</p>
<p>The words hung in the smoky air. They were not a request. They were
the next step in the audit.</p>
<p>“Why?” Alaric asked, though from the dread in his eyes, he already
knew.</p>
<p>“Proof of a different kind,” Elara said. “A body does not lie about
its age. Its teeth, its bones… they tell a story no narrative can
overwrite. If this Millicent was an old woman, born decades before Sir
Guy’s father held this land, then her testimony as a lifelong neighbour
is a fiction. And if she was not old…” She left the thought unfinished.
“It is the pivot. From a story of fraud to a story of something
darker.”</p>
<p>“Murder,” I said.</p>
<p>“The ultimate correction,” she replied.</p>
<p>We sat in silence. The fire warmed our skin but not the cold fact
taking shape in the shelter. We were not just proof of land theft. We
were potential proof of graver sins. Our value had just increased. Our
danger had just multiplied.</p>
<p>“They will come for us,” Alaric said. “Rolf. And others. Not to bring
us back. To correct the error.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Elara said. “Which is why we move at first light. Not to the
capital. Not yet. First, we find the elm. We find the proof that cannot
be argued with. Then we decide our path.”</p>
<p>She assigned watches. Alaric, wounded, was exempted. I took the
first. Elara wrapped herself in a cloak and was asleep against the log
wall in moments, a soldier’s talent. Alaric lay on the furs, his eyes
open, reflecting the fire.</p>
<p>I sat at the shelter’s edge, the ledger in my lap, and watched the
woods. My mind was not my own. It was a field, and I was walking its
rows, looking for something I had misplaced. A memory that belonged to
me.</p>
<p>Fragments surfaced, unbidden. The smell of tar and salt. The feel of
rope, not the coarse hemp of a sack, but the hard, woven lie of a ship’s
line. A sensation of swaying, not on solid earth, but on something that
yielded. A word: <em>starboard</em>. A taste: hardtack, weevily and
dry.</p>
<p>They were not memories with faces or names. They were sensory errors.
Glitches in the narrative of Emeric, the turnip farmer with the dead
ferryman uncle.</p>
<p>Who had I been, before I was a column in a ledger?</p>
<p>The question was a void. Staring into it was like staring into the
dark between the trees. It offered nothing back but the suggestion of
movement. Of something waiting.</p>
<p>Just before dawn, when the world was at its coldest and the fire had
burned to embers, Elara stirred. She woke without a sound, her eyes
opening and fixing on me immediately. She rose, took up her crossbow,
and nodded for me to sleep.</p>
<p>I lay down where Alaric had been. The furs held the residual warmth
of his body. He was already awake, staring at the sooty roof of the
shelter.</p>
<p>“I remember a dog,” he whispered, so low I almost didn’t hear it. “A
brindled thing. One ear chewed off. It slept by my feet. Not in the
Keep. Before.”</p>
<p>“What was its name?” I asked.</p>
<p>He was silent for a long time. “I don’t know. But I remember the
weight of its head on my boots. The smell of wet dog by the fire.” He
turned his head toward me. His eyes were hollow with loss. “Is that
mine? Or did they put it there to make me feel like a man who’d had a
dog?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“We’re going to dig up Millie,” he said. It wasn’t a question.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“She taught me how to mend a fishing net. She said I had clever
fingers.” He held up his hands, the big, scarred hands of a guardsman.
They trembled slightly. “Were those my fingers she was talking
about?”</p>
<p>I had no answer. I closed my eyes and pretended to sleep until the
grey light returned.</p>
<hr />
<p>We found the lightning-struck elm just past midday. It was a giant,
its heart split open by some ancient violence, one side blackened and
dead, the other clinging to life with a few stubborn branches. The
ground beneath it was a tangle of briars and fallen limbs.</p>
<p>“Here,” Alaric said. His voice was thick. He pointed to a slight
depression in the earth, barely noticeable beneath a mat of brown fern.
No marker. No mound. Just a place where the earth had settled.</p>
<p>Elara surveyed the area, her gaze calculating. “We need to be swift.
And quiet.” She unslung her pack and drew out two short, folding spades.
She handed one to me, kept one for herself. Alaric stood watch, his good
hand on the hilt of his seax, his wounded arm held stiff.</p>
<p>The digging was hard. The roots of the elm were a gnarled net, the
soil rocky. My spade struck something with a soft <em>thud</em> much
sooner than I expected. We had not dug a grave’s depth. We had dug only
two feet.</p>
<p>Elara and I cleared the earth with our hands. The fabric was rough,
homespun wool, the colour of mud. It had rotted, but it held the shape
of what was inside. A shroud.</p>
<p>Elara took a knife from her belt and cut a careful slit in the cloth.
She peeled it back.</p>
<p>It was not the body of an old woman.</p>
<p>The skeleton was small. Delicate. The pelvic bone told the story. A
young woman. Perhaps no more than twenty years. Nestled near the ribs
was a tarnished silver pendant, shaped like a tiny lantern.</p>
<p>Alaric made a sound like a wounded animal. He stumbled back, hitting
the trunk of the elm.</p>
<p>“Millicent,” I whispered. But it wasn’t. The Millicent we knew had
been sixty, with hands gnarled from a lifetime of work. This girl had
never had the time for her hands to gnar.</p>
<p>Elara’s face was stone. She reached into the grave and carefully
lifted the skull. She turned it in her hands, examining the teeth, the
suture lines of the cranium. “Young,” she confirmed. She then tilted it,
looking at the base of the skull. Her fingers traced a faint, irregular
depression at the back. “And this was not caused by ague.”</p>
<p>She placed the skull back with a reverence that surprised me. She
looked from the grave to us, her eyes moving between Alaric’s shattered
expression and my own numb horror.</p>
<p>“You are not the only ones,” she said, her voice low and final. “You
are the survivors. The successful iterations. She…” She nodded to the
grave. “She was a draft. A discrepancy that could not be corrected with
a narrative adjustment.”</p>
<p>The world seemed to tilt. The ledger entry <em>Assets
reallocated</em> took on a new, monstrous meaning. The salt and silver
that sustained us… had it been hers first? Were we built on the bones of
the failed attempts?</p>
<p>Alaric pushed himself away from the tree and walked a few paces into
the wood. He bent over, hands on his knees, his back heaving. No sound
came out.</p>
<p>I looked at my hands, dirty with the soil from her grave. The hands
of a steward. A farmer. A fiction. What had these hands done, in the
life before the ledger? Had they held a ship’s wheel? A weapon? Had they
been gentle? Had they been clean?</p>
<p>“We bury her again,” Elara said. “Properly. And then we go. This is
no longer a matter for a surveyor’s report. This is for the King’s
Justiciar. This is treason against the realm itself.”</p>
<p>We refilled the grave, patting the earth down, covering it again with
the ferns. It looked no different than before. But everything was
different. The ledger in my pack was no longer just a record of our
fabrication. It was a testament to the raw material used in its making.
We were not just forged witnesses. We were a palimpsest, written over
the erased lives of others.</p>
<p>As we turned to leave, Alaric stopped. He walked to a young hawthorn
bush near the elm and, with a fierce jerk, broke off a straight branch.
He stripped the thorns and leaves with his knife, leaving a smooth,
white staff. He planted it at the head of the grave. It was not a marker
anyone else would understand. But it was something.</p>
<p>“Her name was Millicent,” he said, to no one. “She mended nets.”</p>
<hr />
<p>We travelled for two days, moving east and south, away from Sir Guy’s
holdings and toward the main road to the capital. Elara set a brutal
pace. We slept in thickets, ate cold parsnips from her pack and what few
early mushrooms Alaric could identify with his false, yet somehow
accurate, woodcraft.</p>
<p>The silence between us was no longer just cautious. It was
sepulchral. We were carrying the ghost of the girl under the elm with
us. And we were carrying the heavier, more dreadful ghost of our own
origins. The question was no longer <em>who had we been?</em> It was
<em>what had we been made from?</em></p>
<p>On the morning of the third day, we crested a wooded rise and saw the
road below. It was a brown ribbon cutting through the greening fields,
dotted with the slow-moving specks of carts and travellers. The world,
going about its business.</p>
<p>Elara crouched behind a screen of hazel, studying the road for a long
time. “There,” she said finally, pointing to a distant crossroads where
a small stone bridge crossed a stream. A group of men was stationed
there. Four of them. Their horses were tethered nearby. Even from this
distance, the glint of steel caps was visible. One man wore a surcoat of
murrey and blue.</p>
<p>Sir Guy’s colours.</p>
<p>“He’s sealed the road,” Alaric muttered.</p>
<p>“He’s looking,” Elara corrected. “He doesn’t know where we are, but
he knows the vectors. The capital is the logical destination. He’s
blocking the most direct path.” She chewed her lip, thinking. “We go
around. Cross the Wending River at the old ford near Hound’s Fall. It’s
longer. Harder. But he won’t have the men to watch every deer path.”</p>
<p>“He will if he’s called in his marker from whoever is above him,” I
said. The thought had been forming in the quiet hours of walking. “The
protocol. The methodology. You said it yourself. He’s not working alone.
He’s a factor in a larger enterprise. If we are a risk to that
enterprise…”</p>
<p>“Then the resources to eliminate us will be greater,” Elara finished.
She did not disagree. “Which is why we must move from being a risk to
being a revelation. We must get the ledger and our testimony before
someone whose authority cannot be brushed aside by a filed report.” She
looked at me. “You understand what that means? Once we step onto that
road, once we speak to the Justiciar, there is no returning to the
field. Emeric Conrad will cease to exist. The ledger will be entered as
evidence. You will be… examined.”</p>
<p>“I am already being examined,” I said, looking at my hands. “I have
been since the moment I forgot my name.”</p>
<p>She held my gaze for a moment, then gave a single, sharp nod. “The
ford it is.”</p>
<p>We slid back from the crest and melted into the woods again. The path
Elara chose was a ghost of a trail, used by beasts and outlaws. The land
grew rougher, the valleys steeper. The Wending River was not a gentle
stream, but a muscular, peat-brown flow, cutting a deep channel through
the land.</p>
<p>We reached Hound’s Fall near dusk. It was not a true waterfall, but a
series of fierce rapids where the river squeezed between jagged rocks.
The roar of the water filled the air. The ford, such as it was, lay
upstream where the river widened and grew shallower over a gravel bed.
The water was high with spring melt, churning and fast.</p>
<p>“We cross in pairs,” Elara shouted over the noise. “You two first.
Use your staff, Alaric. Test the footing. Conrad, hold his belt. I’ll
cover from this bank.”</p>
<p>Alaric eyed the rushing water, his face set. He stepped in, the cold
shocking a gasp from him. The water surged to his thighs. He planted his
hawthorn staff, took a step, then another. I followed, gripping his
belt, the current pulling viciously at my legs. The gravel shifted
treacherously underfoot. Halfway across, Alaric’s staff slipped on a
mossy stone. He lurched. I held on, my feet scrambling for purchase. The
water slammed into my chest, icy and brutal. For a moment, I was back in
the sensory error—the sway, the cold, the roar not of river but of sea.
<em>Hold fast!</em> A voice, not my own, yelled in my memory.</p>
<p>Alaric righted himself. We forged the rest of the way, stumbling onto
the far bank, soaked and gasping.</p>
<p>Elara followed, moving with more grace, her crossbow held high. She
was mid-stream when we heard the horn.</p>
<p>It was a short, blunt sound, cutting through the river’s roar. From
the tree line on the bank we had just left, figures emerged. Five men.
Rolf was at their centre, his face a mask of grim satisfaction. Two held
bows, nocked and drawn. The others had swords.</p>
<p>“ELARA!” I bellowed.</p>
<p>She was exposed, waist-deep in the torrent. She turned, saw them, and
did not hesitate. She dropped flat into the water, submerging herself
and the crossbow.</p>
<p>The arrows hissed. One struck the water where she had been. The other
thudded into a log on our bank.</p>
<p>Rolf yelled an order. Two of the swordsmen began to wade into the
ford after her. The archers kept their aim on the water, waiting for her
to surface.</p>
<p>She did not surface where she had gone under. She appeared ten yards
downstream, where the current curled behind a large, mid-stream boulder.
She rose, water streaming, the crossbow already levelled. It was a
impossible shot, from a rocking, unstable position, against a moving
current.</p>
<p>The <em>thwack</em> of the string was lost in the river’s noise. But
the result was not. One of the archers on the bank staggered, a bolt
protruding from his shoulder. He dropped his bow, screaming.</p>
<p>Elara vanished behind the boulder again.</p>
<p>“Go!” Alaric shouted at me. He was already moving, not back toward
the river, but along our bank, heading downstream toward the boulder,
drawing his seax.</p>
<p>Rolf, enraged, was now wading into the ford himself, his two
remaining men with him. The current was fierce. They struggled, their
focus on the boulder where Elara was pinned.</p>
<p>They had forgotten about us.</p>
<p>I ran after Alaric. The bank was slick and rocky. I saw Elara peer
from behind the boulder, her face pale. She was reloading, her movements
frantic in the chest-deep water. Rolf and his men were closing,
spreading out to flank the rock.</p>
<p>Alaric didn’t try to wade back out. He reached a point on the bank
opposite the boulder, braced himself, and threw his seax.</p>
<p>It was not a weapon made for throwing. It was heavy, single-edged. It
spun once in the air and struck the lead swordsman in the side of the
neck, not with the blade, but with the weighted pommel. It was enough.
The man cried out, lost his footing, and was swept away by the current,
his scream swallowed by the rapids below.</p>
<p>Rolf and the last man faltered, turning toward this new threat.</p>
<p>It gave Elara the second she needed. She raised the reloaded
crossbow, aimed at the remaining swordsman, and fired. The bolt took him
in the chest. He toppled backwards into the water.</p>
<p>Now it was Rolf, alone, halfway between Elara and our bank, the river
pulling at him.</p>
<p>He looked at Elara, behind her rock. He looked at Alaric, unarmed on
the bank. He looked at me, running toward Alaric. His eyes, full of a
furious, professional disappointment, settled on me.</p>
<p>“You,” he snarled, the word carrying over the water. “You useless,
broken thing. I should have retired you with the others.”</p>
<p>He abandoned any attempt to reach Elara. He turned and began forging
directly toward our bank. Toward me. He drew his sword, holding it high
against the drag of the water.</p>
<p>Alaric picked up a stone, ready to throw. Elara was struggling to
reload again, the current threatening to tear her from her perch.</p>
<p>Rolf emerged from the river like a troll from a legend, water
sluicing from his mail, his sword gleaming dully in the twilight. He had
lost his helmet. His face was flushed with effort and rage.</p>
<p>“The ledger, Conrad,” he panted, advancing up the bank. “Give it to
me. And I’ll make it quick for you both. The surveyor too. A tragic
drowning. An accident at the ford.”</p>
<p>I stood my ground. My heart was a frantic drum. I had no weapon. I
had only the ledger in my pack, and the weight of the ghost-girl in my
mind.</p>
<p>“You corrected Millicent,” I said.</p>
<p>He paused, a few yards away. “She was flawed. The narrative wouldn’t
hold. She kept remembering a child’s song in a language we didn’t have a
source for. It was a risk.”</p>
<p>“You killed her.”</p>
<p>“I retired a defective product,” he corrected, his voice cold and
managerial. “To protect the integrity of the operation. Just as I am
doing now.” He raised his sword. “The ledger.”</p>
<p>Alaric threw his stone. It struck Rolf’s mailed shoulder and bounced
away harmlessly. Rolf didn’t even flinch. His eyes were on me.</p>
<p>In that moment, the last of the fiction fell away. I was not Emeric
Conrad, steward. I was not a farmer, or a nephew of a ferryman. I was a
discrepancy. A tear in the vellum. And I was tired of being
corrected.</p>
<p>As Rolf took the final step and brought his sword down in a killing
arc, I didn’t try to dodge. I stepped <em>into</em> it.</p>
<p>It was not a warrior’s move. It was the move of a man who has nothing
left to lose but the story he never owned. I raised my arms, not to
block the blade, but to entangle it. The heavy sword bit deep into the
leather of my pack with a sickening <em>thunk</em> and a screech of torn
metal.</p>
<p>The impact drove me to my knees. But the blade was lodged, tangled in
the pack’s straps and, crucially, in the iron-hard leather of the
ledger’s cover within.</p>
<p>Rolf, expecting no resistance, was wrenched forward, off balance.</p>
<p>Alaric was already moving. He didn’t go for a weapon. He lunged,
wrapping his arms around Rolf from behind, pinning Rolf’s sword-arm.
They crashed to the ground, a tangle of wet mail and fury.</p>
<p>I scrambled back, shrugging off the ruined pack. The ledger was still
inside, the sword buried in it up to its hilt. I left it. I grabbed a
rock the size of my fist.</p>
<p>Rolf was stronger. He drove an elbow into Alaric’s wounded arm.
Alaric grunted in agony, his grip loosening. Rolf twisted, throwing him
off. He rose to his knees, his hand groping for the hilt of his sword,
still stuck fast in my pack.</p>
<p>I swung the rock.</p>
<p>It connected with the side of his head with a sound like an axe
hitting wet wood. He rocked sideways, but didn’t go down. He turned his
dazed eyes toward me, filled with pure, unadulterated hatred. He let go
of the sword and lunged at me, hands reaching for my throat.</p>
<p>A bolt sprouted from his chest.</p>
<p>He stopped, looked down at the fletching protruding from his mail, as
if noticing a spot of dirt. He coughed, and a bubble of blood appeared
on his lips. He looked past me, to the river.</p>
<p>Elara stood on the bank, the crossbow smoking in her hands. She was
drenched, shaking with cold and effort, but her aim had been true.</p>
<p>Rolf sat down heavily, then toppled onto his side. He stared,
unseeing, at the rushing water he had just crossed. The river’s roar was
the only dirge he would get.</p>
<p>Silence descended on our bank, broken only by our ragged breathing
and the eternal river. Alaric clutched his re-opened wound, blood
seeping through the bandage. I dropped the rock. My hands were
trembling.</p>
<p>Elara waded the last few feet to shore. She didn’t look at Rolf’s
body. She walked to my pack, set her foot on it, and wrenched her bolt
from his chest. Then she pulled the sword free from the ledger. She held
the book up. The black cover was ruined, split by the sword cut, the
pages within likely severed. But it was intact enough. The evidence was
still legible.</p>
<p>She tossed the sword into the river. It vanished with a splash.</p>
<p>“They will send more,” she said, her voice hoarse. “Now they have a
body. A provocation. The protocol will demand a full correction.”</p>
<p>“What do we do?” Alaric asked, through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>Elara looked south, toward where the road, and the capital, lay
beyond the wild hills. “We stop being prey. We stop being
discrepancies.” She looked at us, her gaze sweeping from Alaric’s
pain-clenched face to my empty hands. “We become the auditors.”</p>
<p>She slung the damaged ledger over her own shoulder. “We go to the
heart of the machine. Not to the Justiciar. He may be part of it, or he
may be impotent against it. We go to the source of the protocol. The
mapmaker.”</p>
<p>“How?” I asked. The word was a whisper.</p>
<p>“We follow the silver,” she said. “The stipends in your ledger. They
came from somewhere. The narrative adjustments, the methodology—they
have a provenance. We find the mint that struck the coin. We find the
hand that drew the first line.” She started walking, following the
riverbank south. “We use the only thing they gave you that is real.”</p>
<p>“What’s that?” Alaric asked, pushing himself to his feet.</p>
<p>“The hunger,” I said, the realization dawning like a cold, clear
dawn. “The hunger to know who we are.”</p>
<p>Elara nodded. “That is the flaw in their design. You cannot create a
hollow man without creating a void that wants to be filled. And a void
will pull in everything around it, even the truth, to fill itself. You
are not just forged witnesses. You are living questions. And we are
going to take you to the people who have the answers.”</p>
<p>We left Rolf for the crows and the river. We walked away from the
ford, from the territory of Sir Guy, from the turnip field that was the
first lie. We walked into the deepening twilight, three ghosts carrying
a gutted ledger.</p>
<p>I did not look back. There was nothing behind me that was mine.</p>
<p>The first thing I forgot was my own name. Now, I was going to learn
the names of the people who took it. I was going to learn the shape of
the machine that built me from borrowed memories and buried bones. I was
going to read the ledger of my own making, not as a subject, but as an
accountant of the abyss.</p>
<p>The final audit was no longer a trial. It was a hunt. And the quarry
was the truth.</p>
<p>We disappeared into the gathering dark, a new column waiting to be
written. <em>Liabilities: The entire, hidden architecture of the
world.</em> <em>Assets: One ruined ledger. One royal surveyor with a
grievance. One guardsman who remembered a dog. And one hollow man,
finally full of purpose.</em></p>
